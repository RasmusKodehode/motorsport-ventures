        <h1>Welcome to the world of sportscars</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The debut of the Le Mans Prototype in 1999 marked the 
        start of the modern era of sportscar racing, with the new 
        cars being able to race not only at the 24h of Le Mans, 
        but also in a new 
        championship series in America using the same 
        regulations from the ACO. Further series in Europe 
        and Asia were initially planned and some became reality, 
        leading to the creation of the FIA 
        World Endurance Championship in 2012. This led 
        to the demise of the top class in America, but after 
        the creation of the Le Mans Hypercar in 2021 and LMDh 
        in 2023 the top class of sportscar 
        racing is again shared across championships both 
        in Europe and America.</p>

        <h2>Before 1999</h2>
        <p>As Group C died out in the Early 90s, leading to 
        the end of the World Sportscar Championship at the end 
        of 1992, and the GTP class being replaced in the IMSA GT 
        championship after 1993, the top class increasingly consisted 
        of smaller, slower open-cockpit prototypes with production 
        based engines, called the World Sports Car (WSC). These 
        were only moderately successful, leading ACO to open up 
        the top class at Le Mans both to older Group C cars, but 
        also allowing GT cars to be able to fight for the overall 
        win as part of the new LMGT1 class. In 1995 the top class 
        became available only to WSC-cars, but the LMGT1 regulations 
        were kept the same. What manufacturers realised was that 
        the GT1 regulations were so open that they could basically 
        built a bespoke prototype and only built 1 road-going 
        version to be able to race. this was first exploited in 
        1994 when Dauer modified a Porsche 962C and created 1 
        roadcar, allowing them to take the overall win with the 
        Dauer 962. McLaren teamed up with BMW to create the McLaren 
        F1 GTR, to take their overall win in 1995. While Porsche, 
        together with TWR and Joest Racing won with a WSC car 
        in 1996 and 1997, Several new manufacturers built new 
        GT1 cars specifically for that race. Porsche Entered the 
        911 GT1 in 1996, Nissan and Panoz debuted the R391 GT1 
        and GTR-1 in 1997, and in 1998 Toyota joined with their 
        purpose-built GT-One together with Mercedes with the CLK-LM. 
        At this point the open nature of the regulations were 
        becoming ridiculous, with manufacturers building cars 
        specifically for this class because they only needed to 
        produce a single road-going model. The regulations specified 
        since these were supposed to be GT cars, that they needed 
        boot space capable of holding a standard size suitcase. 
        Mercedes had placed this space underneath the rear bodywork in a 
        very impractical place. Meanwhile, Toyota managed to 
        convince the scrutineers that because the fuel tank of 
        the GT-One was empty during scrutineering, it could theoretically 
        fit the required space. The by now complete disregard 
        for the intention of the regulations, combined with Mercedes 
        wiping the field clean in the newly created FIA GT Championship 
        to the extent that nobody else entered the class in 1999, 
        the FIA were forced to drop the class for that year. 
        This forced the ACO to rethink the class structure at 
        Le Mans, leading to the creation of the Le Mans Prototype (LMP) 
        and the Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype (LMGTP). Cars 
        in the old LMGT1 class could be modified to fit in the 
        LMGTP class for closed cockpit prototypes, while the LMP 
        class was for open cockpit cars. The GT1 class was dropped, 
        with the former GT2 class being renamed GTS as the top 
        GT class, with GT3-spec cars being eligible in the new 
        GT class. With the introduction of these new cars, the ACO 
        looked for opportunities to create a championship with 
        Le Mans-style regulations. They struck an Agreement with IMSA 
        to replace the IMSA GT Championship with the new American Le Mans 
        Series starting in 1999 after testing the format in the penultimate 
        round of the 1998 IMSA GT Championship, which became the first running 
        of the Petit Le Mans. The IMSA GT Championship had just lost two 
        of its key events to the newly revived US Road Racing Championship, 
        which soon after became the Rolex Sports Car Series. The split caused 
        the two series to be direct competitors, IMSA with their ageing 
        WSC prototypes, and the USRRC creating their own prototype class together 
        with the International Sports Racing Series in Europe. IMSA saw the 
        opportunity to partner with the ACO and create the ALMS with the new 
        LMP's making up the top class. For ACO this was just the start, and they 
        were planning similar championships in Europe and Asia as well.</p>

        <h2>1999 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The demise of the LMGT1 class led Toyota and Mercedes to adapt their 
        GT-One and CLK-LM to fit in the LMGTP class, the Mercedes becoming the CLR.
        Nissan chose to modify the R390 to become the open-cockpit R391 LMP.
        Porsche started work on a new car, the LMP2000, but discussions over which engine to use delayed the project to 2000, and then it was cancelled in the spring of 1999 due to internal politics.
        BMW modified their V12 LM from 1998 built for the WSC-spec top class into the V12 LMR
        to race in the new LMP class. Audi joined the sportscar scene with two newly developed 
        cars, the R8R for the LMP class, and the R8C for the LMGTP class. The R8R was designed 
        and built by Dallara in Italy, whereas the R8C was designed by Racing Technology Norfolk 
        in the UK. Both programs were operated by Joest Racing. Panoz also designed the new LMP-1 Roadster-S, 
        a front-engined open-cockpit LMP. BMW debuted the V12 LMR at the first round of the ALMS at Sebring, 
        and they were joined by Audi with their R8R. Whereas Audi only did Sebring before focusing on Le Mans, 
        BMW ran a partial season, only skipping the second round between Sebring and Le Mans. The new Panoz joined 
        the ALMS at the second round and completed the season in addition to Le Mans.
        Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan focused only on Le Mans. As part of the process of 
        expanding sportscar racing across the world, the ACO planned a non-championship Le Mans-style race in Japan
        to gauge the interest in Asia for an ALMS-type series. Toyota and Nissan both sent a car 
        each to the race in addition to competing at Le Mans.</p>

                <br>Factory teams from BMW, Toyota, Mercedes, Audi, Nissan and Panoz were present in the top category
                <br>The event marred by three airborne accidents and subsequent withdrawal of Mercedes, with the #4 not taking the start after taking off first during practice and then again in the Saturday morning warm-up, and the #5 spectacularly taking off on Saturday evening. The remaining #6 was then withdrawn
                <br>Toyota were the favourites to win, but the team struggled with explosive punctures, #1 retiring on Saturday evening, and the #2 crashing out heavily during the night. The #3 was catching the leader towards the end of the race, but suffered another puncture in the last hour, ending the race in 2nd
                <br>BMW didn't have the fastest car, but they took the lead by having to pit less often for fuel, and having fewer mechanical issues. #17 was on couse to win but crashed out on Sunday with just a few hours to go, handing the lead and the win to the #15
                <br>Nissan and Panoz struggled with reliability, while Audi didn't have the ultimate pace, but good reliability meant the two R8Rs finished 3rd and 4th

        <h2>2000 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After the scary accidents suffered by the Mercedes' at Le Mans was found to be because of a fundamental aerodynamic instability of the car, the team withdrew from racing and the CLRs never raced again. 
        Nissan and Toyota both also withdrew from sportscars at the end of the year, with Toyota planning to enter F1. 
        BMW Entered F1 in 2000, thus ending their international sportscar program, but they continued racing with Schnitzer for the full season of ALMS. 
        They were joined by Audi debuting their new R8 after getting up to speed in 1999. 
        Cadillac joined with the new Northstar LMP, testing it in both the ALMS and the GARRC, however it was proving uncompetitive.
        <br>ACO again restructured the classes for Le Mans, renaming the previous year's LMP class LMP900, and adding the LMP675-class for smaller, lighter prototypes. The prototypes running in the GARRC and the FIA Sportscar Championship could be modified to run in either class. The 900/675-designation refers to the minimum weight of the cars, 900 kg for the top class, 675 kg for the other.
        <br>ALMS expanded the calendar for 2000, including 2 rounds in Europe to help launch the ELMS for 2001, as well as the final round in Australia to launch the APLMS a year later.

        <h2>2001 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After not making the trip to Australia with their prototypes, BMW retired their V12 LMRs, and for 2001 they competed in the GT class with the new V8-powered M3 GTR. 
        Audi continued racing in ALMS alongside Le Mans with two factory cars, in addition they also sold customer cars to Champion Racing in ALMS and Johansson Motorsport in ELMS.
        Panoz debuted the LMP07, but after suffering big problems with reliability in the first part of the season
        they chose to abandon the new car and brought back the old cars. 
        Bentley debuted the closed-cockpit EXP Speed 8 at Le Mans, reviving the LMGTP class which had no entrants in 2000.
        The dominant Dodge Vipers were retired from the GTS class as Chrysler started developement of a brand new LMP-car together with Oreca. The new car debuted at the Donington ELMS-race.
        <br>After debuting at Le Mans in 2000, ALMS took on the LMP900 and LMP675 classes as well in place of the general LMP-class used in 1999 and 2000. ELMS also ran the same 4 classes.
        <br>After the ALMS staged two races in Europe in 2000, ALMS organizer Professional Sports Car Racing was looking to expand and the ELMS was launched as a sister series in Europe, with four races shared between the two series, 
        which were optional for the teams. Sebring and Petit Le Mans were optional for the European teams, while the events at Donington Park and Jarama 
        were optional for the American teams. Due to a lack of interest from teams, the ELMS only lasted one season and was not continued for 2002. The ELMS ended up competing against series like FIA Sportscar Championship 
        and FIA GT Championship which used similar cars, but they had to be modified to race in ELMS. This meant few teams were interested in racing in ELMS due to the resources necessary and impracticality of competing across the different series.
        The APLMS were also scheduled to start in the autums with events at Sepang and Adelaide, but these were cancelled for various reasons, and although the series was set to go ahead in 2002, it was abandoned due to a lack of interest.
        <br>Plans were announced in September 1999 to build a new race track in Aruba. The organizer had an agreement to host the ALMS season opener in 2001, however the 4.345 km <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000124182926/http:/www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/alms990928.html" target="_blank">Aruba International Raceway</a> was never built due to a conflict between the track promoter and the Aruban government over funding and the event was never officially on the <a href="https://us.motorsport.com/alms/news/alms-announces-2001-schedule/1841229/" target="_blank">2001 calendar</a>. The failure to comply with the agreements made with ALMS and other series it was supposed to host the organizer ended up mired in legal cases, which the Aruban government eventually lost after shutting down the plans.

        <h2>2002 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi and Panoz continued their programs in ALMS, with Panoz debuting the LMP01 Evo, an updated version of the LMP-1 Roadster-S following the previous year's flawed LMP07. Panoz' and Audis also competed in the hands of privateer teams, Audi with Champion Racing, and Panoz with several teams, of note MBD who used the discarded LMP07s fitted with Mugen engines. Cadillac continued their program racing at Le Mans as well as a partial ALMS season, debuting their new Northstar LMP02 with an all new chassis, and it was proving increasingly competititive towards the end of the season. Bentley continued racing at Le Mans with the EXP Speed 8 whilst developing a new car for 2003.
        <br>BMW meanwhile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020306213820/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/main.cfm?contents=/series/alms/contents.cfm&banner=/2001_sc_header.cfm&header=/imsa_header.htm&page=/2002/news/news02/012202e.cfm" target="_blank">announced in January the cancellation of its ALMS GT program</a> with the M3 GTR after rule changes for the LMGT category limiting its competitiveness of the controversial V8 engine.
        <br>Ferrari debuted a new car in the GTS class, the 550 Maranello, which was developed in parallel by Team Rafanelli in Italy and Prodrive in the UK. The car initially proved uncompetitive, but after switching from a 5.5L to a 6.0L V12 engine, it started challenging the Corvettes.
        <br>At the end of 2001 the ALMS organizer changed its name from Professional Sports Car Racing to bring back the famous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011113025726fw_/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/100501d.htm" target="_blank">IMSA</a> name it had held previously, until a change of ownership in 1997.
        <br>After completing the final races of the ELMS in 2001 with as few as 14 cars on the grid, the 2002 season was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020209083424/http://www.autosport.com/newsitem.cfm?id=17522&series=12" target="_blank">cancelled in december</a> citing the lack of entrants and the unstable nature of the world following the events of 11th of September.
        <br>The ALMS announced an expanded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011113025726fw_/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/100501e.htm" target="_blank">calendar</a>, with new events at Road America, Washington D.C., Trois-Rivieres and Miami, and a move away from rovals that had been on the calendar in the previous years. The calendar was initially announced with longer races, with all races being at least 3-4 hours long, however most events were reverted back to the normal 2h 45min format after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020306220253/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/main.cfm?contents=/series/alms/contents.cfm&banner=/2001_sc_header.cfm&header=/imsa_header.htm&page=/2002/news/news02/010802b.cfm" target="_blank">input from TV broadcasters</a>. Following the failure of the ELMS in Europe, ALMS returned to only hosting races inside North America.
        <br>With the planned debut of the APLMS in 2001 hitting trouble with both its first two rounds cancelled for various reasons, the series were abandoned with the Malaysia event becoming an invitational event.

                <br>Panoz entered 3 cars but the #49 didn't start after a crash during the wet warm-up
                <br>Heavy rain at the start of the race meant a safety-car start, with the green flag after 20 min, track drying gradually
                <br>Big crash for the #1 Audi causing extensive damage, but it managed to rejoin after dragging it back to the pits and changing the entire rear end
                <br>Panoz won the race with more pace in the rain and a car better suited to the track

        <h2>2003 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi pulled out of sportscar racing after 2002 as a works team, however the cars kept racing for privateer teams. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030724235027/http:/www.imsaracing.net/imsa.cfm?h=/2003/news/header.htm&p=/2003/news/020503b.htm" target="_blank">Joest Racing</a> and Champion Racing contested ALMS, With Champion Racing joining Audi Sport Team UK and the Japanese Team Goh at Le Mans.
        <br>Panoz also pulled out as a factory team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030724235820/http:/www.imsaracing.net/imsa.cfm?h=/2003/news/header.htm&p=/2003/news/020703b.htm" target="_blank">with its two LMP01s racing under the JML Team Panoz banner</a> in both ALMS and Le Mans, however the ageing cars struggled for pace.
        <br>Bentley debuted a new car, the Speed 8, contesting the 12h of Sebring for the first time as well as Le Mans. Tom Kristensen and Dindo Capello jumped ship from Audi to join the team.
        <br>After its most successful year of the program, Cadillac elected not to extend the project, and did not return to sportscar racing in 2003.
        <br>In the GT class, Ferrari debuted with the 360 Modena GTC, initially struggeling to be competitive against the armada of Porsches, though getting faster with more developement by the time 2004 started.
        <br><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2114431/new-events-mexico-europe-highlight-2003-alms-schedule/" target="_blank">ALMS revealed the new calendar for 2003</a> with a new race in Mexico City, as well as a planned race in Europe in May. However the European race was soon <a href="https://au.motorsport.com/alms/news/2003-schedule-finalized/1011711/" target="_blank">abandoned after a suitable venue couldn't be agreed on</a>. The format of the Road America race was also changed from 500 Miles to the standard 2h 45min.
        <br>Meanwhile, two years on from the failed ELMS, ACO tried again to plan its own sportscar championship in Europe. To prepare for this, it set up another experimental race at La Sarthe to check the interest before committing to the new LMES in 2004.

                <br>There was drama as the #30 Intersport went off and crashed into a flatbed truck recovering the #20 Dyson which had gone off earlier, the accident caused extensive damage and the car retired
                <br>#88 Prodrive led GTS until contact with the #1 Joest car in T1 sent it off the road, however it managed to come back and take the win. The #24 Porsche won GT despite suffering damage very early in the race after contact with the Rafanelli car ripped the passenger side door off and causing extensive damage to the side
                <br>#38 Champion Audi had a big lead after all the problems for Joest, but it too suffered a slow stop with a battery change as the car refused to start, and it later had to make an extra stop after dislodging the nose
                <br>The Panoz-cars were running reliably, with the #10 taking 2nd behind the Champion car, while the #11 ended up 4th after suffering with power steering failure

        <h2>2004 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi started work on a new car to succeed the R8, which would ultimately debut in 2006. Meanwhile the Joest Team ended their program in ALMS, leaving only Champion Racing competing in the US. In Europe, Team Goh and Audi Sport UK also operated Audis in the new LMES, with Team UK also making the trip to Sebring.
        <br>After winning Le Mans in the 3rd year of the program, Bentley ended their sportscar program and didn't return. Panoz too elected not to return in the top class with the LMP01, instead focusing on their GT-class program.
        <br>With the new LMP1 regulations, the Reynard 02S project was revived, originally developed in 2002 before the company went bankrupt, the design was taken over by International Racing Management and renamed the DBA 03S. As Zytek was being tasked with building more of these chassis, they were also badged as the Zytek 04S. The cars were run by several teams and they were proving to have good pace but struggled with reliability.
        <br>In the GTS class, Ferrari debuted the 575 Maranello, an evolution of the 550 at Sebring as well as the full LMES season. Lamborghini also joined the class in ALMS at Mid-Ohio with the Murcielago R-GT, however the car struggled for pace and reliability.
        <br>ACO announced changes in the class structure, with LMP900 and LMP675 being replaced by LMP1 and LMP2. LMP900 and LMGTP-cars moved to LMP1, and LMP675 cars could be converted to either of the new classes. Rule changes were also announced for LMP1 with overhang limited and the floor structure changed to limit downforce and make the cars less likely to take off. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms292.htm" target="_blank">IMSA announced that they would delay enforcing these new rules in ALMS,</a> allowing both new LMP1 and LMP2 cars and old LMP900 and LMP675 cars to compete in what became the P1 and P2 class. This allowed Dyson racing to continue using their LMP675 MG-Lolas, moving them into the P1 class.
        <br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060629012254/http:/motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=140336&FS=ALMS" target="_blank">ALMS announced their new calendar for 2004</a>, with a focus on making sure all events could be run following cancellations and replacements in the last few years. The calendar included a return to Mid-Ohio and Portland, as well as a new event at Lime Rock Park. Laguna Seca also became the season finale, with the race extended to 4 hours.
        <br>After the Announcement of the 1000 km of Le Mans preview race in 2003, ACO launched the new Le Mans Endurance Series, with <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2003lmes/lmes_075.htm" target="_blank">4 1000km events across Europe.</a> Having learned from the ELMS in 2001, the new series attracted several teams from the FIA Sportscar championship and FIA GT championship, forcing the end of those series.

                <br>#88 Team UK Audi led from pole ahead of the #5 Team Goh car which lost time replacing the ECU early, however the #88 then lost time in the night serving a penalty for overtaking under yellow flags and then colliding with the #64 Corvette. The #5 also lost time in the night fixing a misfire during an SC-period that had plagued the car for a few hours
                <br>The #88 Audi kept the lead until it had to pit in the morning to repair a suspension issue, and with 7 minutes spent in the garage, the #5 Team Goh Audi took over the lead. Despite a few moments like an early pit stop to change flat-spotted tyres after a heavy lock-up and a brief fire during refuelling, they held on to take the win despite withstanding pressure from the faster #88 breathing down its neck

                <br>#3 Zytek had pole, but contact with one of the Team UK Audis at the start gave it a puncture and it dropped out of contention. The #8 and #88 battled for the lead down to Les Combes where they tangled, giving the #5 Goh car the lead, however the #8 reclaimed the lead shortly after
                <br>Rain came and went throughout the day, with the #17 Pescarolo crashing out in an early rain shower, and the #8 crashed out dramatically after another heavier shower passed through, driving the car back to the pits on fire
                <br>After the initial chaos the #88 Audi took the lead and stayed out front to win ahead of the #5 Goh car

        <h2>2005 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>With the ageing Audi R8 still being competitive, the ACO announced that 2005 would be the last year that cars built to the old LMP900 rules would be permitted to race, and the cars were also handicapped with more ballast and less power than the newer LMP1 machines. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms446.htm" target="_blank">Older generation LMP900 cars would still be allowed to race in ALMS</a>, with IMSA not enforcing the new rules yet, allowing older cars to compete alongside newer LMP1 cars.
        <br>The FIA and ACO also revised the classes for GT-cars, with LMGTS and LMGT replaced by LMGT1 and LMGT2. The new classes were designed to more tightly control and balance the cars, with specific laptime requirements set. The new structure meant new cars would have to be homologated by the FIA before being allowed to compete.
        <br>In the US, Champion Racing continued racing their two R8s, also competing at Le Mans. Audi Sport Team UK and Team Goh chose not to continue beyond 2004, with Team Oreca taking over one of the R8s to compete in the LMES and Le Mans.
        <br>In Europe, a new challenger to the Audis Emerged in the form of Pescarolo. After several years of developing their Courage-designed C60, and after switching from Peugeot to a Judd V10 engine, the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid was proving fast enough to take on Audi, with the team completing the LMES season and Le Mans with a pair of cars.
        <br>In the GT-classes, new cars were introduced with the new regulations. Corvette replaced the old C5-R with the new C6.R, and Aston Martin joined with the brand new DBR9. There was also controversy as <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms584.htm" target="_blank">IMSA allowed Maserati to run in the GT1 clas in ALMS with the MC12</a>, despite the car not being built to LMGT1 spec. The decision drew criticism from ACO and from several of the teams, with <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms611.htm" target="_blank">Aston Martin protesting the car at the first round in Sebring</a>. Meanwhile <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms481.htm" target="_blank">Lamborghini didn't continue into 2005</a> with the Krohn-Barbour team not feeling the necessary factory support to make the cars competitive.
        <br>The schedule for the 24h of Le Mans was adjusted after discussions between IMSA and the ACO who were finding it challenging to schedule races early in the season with the mandatory test day being a month before the race forcing both ALMS and LMES to effectively take a long break to allow teams to race at Le Mans. In 2005 the test day was moved to 2 weeks before the race, allowing more flexibility for ALMS to schedule more races early in the season.
        <br>IMSA focused on concistency in the <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms479.htm" target="_blank">ALMS calendar</a>, keeping all events from 2004 as well as adding the return of a sprint event at Road Atlanta. they also took advantage of the Le Mans test day being moved to reschedule Mid-Ohio to May, before Le Mans.
        <br>LMES also focused on steady growth after a successful first season, keeping the 4 events from 2004, and <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2005lmes/lmes_261.htm" target="_blank">adding a fifth round at the new Istanbul Park</a>.

                <br>Exeptionally hot temperatures throughout the race hitting 30+ degrees, causing big challenges keeping cars and drivers cool
                <br>The two Pescarolos led the early stages, but already 1h in they started suffering issues, with the #17 damaging the suspension after contact, and the #16 suffered gearbox issues at the 2h mark. More technical and mechanical issues dropped them further down the order on Saturday evening
                <br>The #2 Champion Audi took the lead following the Pescarolos' gremlins with the Audis lying 1-2-3, however on cold tyres after a safety car-period the #2 went off the road and suffered front end damage, costing it time needing repairs in the garage
                <br>The #4 Team Oreca Audi also suffered issues in the night, twice being rolled into the garage for suspension repairs
                <br>#2 Audi went off again on Sunday morning after a tyre failure, getting stuck in the gravel and then losing more time being repaired in the garage
                <br>#17 Pescarolo suffered a myriad of issues on Sunday morning, ending in retirement after crashing out and suffering extensive damage
                <br>By Sunday lunchtime the #16 Pescarolo was back in 2nd and catching the leading Audi at a pace that it could catch the lead by the end of the race. However, with less that 2h to go it was starting to overheat, with the team briefly rolling it back to the garage to clean the radiators and cruising to 2nd place
                <br>This meant the #3 Champion Audi could control the pace after a flawless run to take the win, with Tom Kristensen taking a record-breaking 7th Le Mans win

                <br>Drama in the last hour as the #20 Dyson was involved in a pile-up and crashed out, the #16 pitted from the lead before the safety car was called. However, the car wouldn't restart, and the #1 Audi re-took the lead
                <br>#2 Audi was also involved in the pile-up, but it suffered minimal damage and was able to fix it without losing a lot of time
                <br>There was confusion as the race was restarted with a truck still on the track, luckily all the cars avoided it, and the safety car came back out very quickly as the #20 retired with gearbox failure, dropping oil on the track. However there was still time for the #2 to take the lead, but race control deemed that the yellow flags were waived despite neither the drivers nor the team saw them, forcing them to swap the places back
                <br>When the race restarted the delayed #16 got back on the lead lap to try to chase down the Audis, until the gear linkage broke and the car retired in the last 10 minutes. The two Audis battled for the lead, with #1 holding on to take the win

                <br>The weather throughout was trecherous, with a lot of drivers complaining about dangerous conditions, with the safety car several times being deployed because of the intensity of rain and standing water. A meeting was held approaching the half way point, discussing the possibility of ending the race at 3h 30 min, but with skies brightning, the race continued
                <br>After more pit cycles and safety car periods as darkness fell the #4 Audi caught the leading #7 DBA, and with 45 min left took the lead. They fought tooth and nail in the closing minutes, with the Audi holding on to take the win

                <br>#15 Zytek was fastest in qualifying, but due to a technical infringement was disqualified and sent to the back of the grid
                <br>#7 DBA inherited pole and led the opening laps before being overtaken by the #17 Pescarolo while they battled through traffic
                <br>#15 Zytek battled its way from the back to the top 10 in the first half hour, before an overtake under yellow earned it a stop/go penalty
                <br>The Pescarolo lost the lead through the first pit cycle being forced to fix some rear damage, with the #4 Audi benefitting to take the lead
                <br>The #17 Pescarolo's woes were further compounded, first spinning after contact, and then got a stop/go penalty for overtaking under yellow
                <br>The #4 Audi and #7 DBA fought a strategic battle, with the #7 taking the lead at the third round of stops when the Audi got stuck in traffic, only for the Audi to strike back at the next cycle when the DBA had a slow tyre change
                <br>#15 Zytek kept closing gradually on the leaders throughout the race, and in the final stint caught and passed the #7 DBA on the second attempt following a trip through the gravel, and then catching and passing the leading #4 Audi in the closing laps to take the win

                <br>The race was supposed to run for 2h 45min, but a fuel shortage caused by hurricane Katrina forced the race to be shortened

        <h2>2006 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>With the ACO outlawing old LMP900 cars from Le Mans, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans730.htm" target="_blank">Audi revealed the R10 TDI</a> to replace the R8. That also coincided with Audi returning as a factory team, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms764.htm" target="_blank">cooperating with Champion Racing in ALMS with team Joest running the cars at Le Mans</a>. With IMSA still allowing older cars to compete, it also gave them the opportunity to take a single R8 on a farewell tour over the first few ALMS rounds while the R10s were testing for Le Mans. News also came in 2005 that <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans685.htm" target="_blank">Peugeot would also join LMP1 in 2007</a> with their own diesel-powered prototype.
        <br>After debuting in the ALMS season finale in 2005, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms630.htm" target="_blank">Porsche launched into the first full season with its Penske-run LMP2 car</a>. The team was however not allowed to race at Le Mans, due to the ACO not allowing factory teams in the LMP2 class. Pescarolo continued racing in Europe with its C60 Hybrid, after a successful 2005-season.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms684.htm" target="_blank">ALMS released a new calendar</a>, with Sonoma and the spring race at Road Atlanta being replaced by a race at the new Miller Motorsports Park in Utah, and a new street circuit in Houston Texas, run together with Champ Car.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2005lmes/lmes_387.htm" target="_blank">LMES continued with a 5-race calendar</a> with a few shuffled dates, as well as switching the British round from Silverstone to Donington Park. The series also underwent a slight rebranding, and became known simply as the Le Mans Series.
        <br>Work conducted by the people behind Team Goh culminated in the <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/other/2005other/other999_023.htm", target="_blank">debut of the new ACO-backed Japan Le Mans Challenge</a>, organizing 3 1000 km races in Japan, in an effort to get japanese teams interested in international sportscar racing.

                <br>Pole sitting #2 Audi suffered issues in the warm-up, and had to start from the pit lane after replacing a heat exchanger before the start. That left #1 on pole, ahead of the two Porsches
                <br>Both Porsches suffered problems in the opening hours with #7 briefly stopping on track, and the #6 was forced into the pits to replace a broken alternator. #7 later had to pit for lengthy repairs to a broken radiator and steering issues
                <br>#1 Audi led the early stages despite a spin after getting confused in traffic with #2 catching up to lie 2nd. However #1 then retired with an overheating engine around the 4 hour mark
                <br>#2 was left alone out front, but it wasn't plain sailing as it suffered issues in the pits at the half way point, struggling to remove a loose wheel as well as having to clean the fuel filter
                <br>The Porsches continued to suffer reliability issues, with #7 retiring with a broken driveshaft 5 hours from the end, and #6 retired in the final hour with an oil leak
                <br>Despite the issues encountered, #2 Audi cruised home to take the win

                <br>LMGT2 Winner: #97 GPC Sport, Ferrari F430 GTC, Luca Drudi(ITA), Gabrio Rosa(ITA), Fabrizio de Simone(ITA), +15 Laps
                <br>#17 Pescarolo started on pole as the race started in damp but drying conditions, however it dropped a few places after contact on the first lap as the #13 Courage, and then #9 Creation took the lead on superior wet tyres
                <br>The Pescarolo soon fought back to take the lead on lap 4, however the drying conditions meant the leaders soon pitted for slicks
                <br>#9 Creation re-took the lead after everyone had pitted, but the Pescarolo was right behind and they traded places until the 2nd round of pit stops, where the Pescarolo ended up with a substantial lead after taking only fuel, with Creation also taking tyres
                <br>Following this the #9 Creation slowed and retired with a gearbox issue, as 1h 45min in race control announced the race would finish at 4 hours due to a fuel shortage at the track
                <br>This left the #17 Pescarolo out front, and it cruised to take the win

                <br>A chicane was added just after T1 the day before the weekend to slow the cars before T2 where the braking zone was very bumpy
                <br>#16 Dyson took pole in front of the two Porsches and led until the #7 Porsche muscled its way past early on, with the #2 Audi following through after tangling with the #6 Porsche which suffered a puncture
                <br>By the half way point the #2 Audi had taken control, and after pitting early for its 2nd stop handed the lead back to #7 Porsche, it came into the pits with electrical issues, and despite continuing briefly after changing the battery, it soon returned to the pits and retired. #6 Porsche soon after suffered a gearbox failure and stopped on track, it too retiring
                <br>The #2 Audi cruised to the finish to take the win

                <br>#9 Creation was withdrawn from the race after a crash in practice, with the #17 Pescarolo also involved in an incident, forcing it to start from the pit lane
                <br>#5 Courage took pole in a wet qualifying and led at the start, however a big pile-up at the top of Raidillion eliminated 6 cars and triggered an immediate safety car, before the red flag came out on lap 2 with stricken cars and debris scattered across the track
                <br>The race restarted 50 minutes later, but another accident under the safety car meant another delay before the race got going
                <br>As the race restarted, the #12 Courage pressured the leaders, going from 3rd to the lead in a single lap and starting to pull away. However #17 Pescarolo was hounding its way through the field and was 2nd by the end of the 2nd hour
                <br>After catching the leading Courage #17 Pescarolo took the lead in the 3rd hour as they fought through traffic, with the lead growing significantly as they both pitted during a safety car period where the #12 Courage suffered electrical issues at pit exit
                <br>That meant the Pescarolo had a big lead and duly cruised home to take an easy win

                <br>#6 Porsche raced away in the lead, with #2 Audi and #16 Dyson battling for 2nd with the recovering #7 Porsche joining in already after a few laps. The trio traded places until the first cycle of pit stops, where the #7 Porsche pitted first and ended up in 2nd after everyone else had made their stops
                <br>#2 Audi and #16 Dyson continued scrapping for 3rd behind the two Porsches which were also trading places, with #7 Taking the lead by the time they emerged from the 2nd pit cycle
                <br>After scrapping throughout the 2nd sting #16 Dyson suffered a tyre failure and went off, bringing out the safety car in the final hour
                <br>That meant the Porsches ran 1-2 through the final stint, with #7 leading home #6, with #2 Audi coming home 3rd

                <br>The Audis locked out the front row ahead of the two Pescarolos, and #7 led the early stages, although they traded places in the first few hours, with the #16 Pescarolo briefly holding 2nd after an early pit stop under safety car put it out of sequence
                <br>The race quickly became a stranglehold by the Audis, having more pace and better fuel economy than the Pescarolos.
                <br>Problems started during the 3rd hour for the leading #7 Audi, first having to make an extra pit stop after rubber dislodged the windscreen, and an hour later it was in the garage to replace the fuel injectors, which dropped it down the order
                <br>The two Pescarolos also suffered issues in the early night hours, #16 had a lengthy stay in the garage trying to fix some electrical issues, and #17 went off and got stuck in the gravel
                <br>#7 Audi was back in the garage approaching 9h in after suffering contact breaking a wishbone, and after rejoining briefly it came back to the garage with floor damage
                <br>#8 Audi had a comfortable lead, but nearing the half way point there was drama as it was wheeled into the garage with gearbox issues, however it managed to exit the pits still leading. It soon had to pit again with a slow puncture, but the time loss was minimal
                <br>As Sunday morning dawned the leading #8 had another scare, with a marshal stopping it at the end of the pit lane, forcing it to be rolled back to the pit box after one of the headlamps had failed. Shortly afterwards #7 slowed on track again, spending yet more time in the garage with a broken turbocharger
                <br>During the rest of Sunday the cars ran reliably, with #8 cruising home to take the win ahead of the #17 Pescarolo and the recovering #7 Audi

                <br>However when the safety car came in the #2 Audi chased down and passed the #7 Porsche as it again was baulked in traffic, and went on to take the final win for the Audi R8

                <br>The two returning Audi R10s locked out the front row, with the Porsches lacking some pace in qualifying ending up 4th and 5th
                <br>#1 led from pole, but ran wide on the first lap, letting #2 and #16 Dyson past. After briefly getting back past the Dyson the #1 misjudged traffic and spun after contact, and then got flustered getting back up to speed, costing it more places
                <br>#6 Porsche had to make an early first stop after flat-spotting the tyres just 30 min in, however as the rest of the leaders made their first stops it cycled to the lead ahead of the #2 Audi
                <br>The Audis made their final stops early, both cars taking only fuel, and when the #6 Porsche pitted from the lead and took fuel and tyres, it emerged in 2nd overall.

                <br>#13 Courage then pitted on lap 9 and went into the garage with clutch failure, eventually retiring. That left #12 Courage in 2nd, and after the first round of pit stops it was putting pressure on the leading Pescarolo, at one point sending it to the inside and slammed into the side of the Pescarolo, #12 spinning as a result
                <br>#9 Creation was 3rd in the middle stages of the race until a puncture dropped it down the order. Approaching half way the #12 Courage pitted from 2nd, going into the garage with a fuel pump issue.

                <br>#14 Dome took over 2nd, however the #9 Creation was fighting back following the puncture earlier, and after pressuring the Dome in the final hour it cracked and ran wide, handing 2nd to the Creation with 5 minutes left
                <br>Meanwhile the #17 Pescarolo was cruising as the opposition faltered, and took a comfortable win

                <br>Qualifying cancelled due to heavy rain, grid set on practice times, leaving #16 Dyson on pole ahead of #2 Audi and #7 Porsche
                <br>#16 led the early stages, as #1 Audi went from 6th to 3rd on the opening lap, overtaking both Porsches and #20 Dyson. The Porsches initially struggled for pace, however as the first stint went on the pace picked up and #7 overtook #20 for 4th
                <br>The leading #16 and #2 Audi traded places, with #2 prevailing and opening up a lead, allowing it to take tyres at its first stop and maintain the lead despite massive pressure on the outlap from #16 which took fuel only
                <br>#2 Audi then made its 2nd stop at the earliest opportunity, taking fuel only and staying in front by the time the rest had pitted. It stayed at the front to take the win, despite coming under late pressure on worn tyres from #20 Dyson

                <br>#17 Pescarolo led away from pole, but under pressure from #12 and #13 Courages, with #12 taking the lead and starting to pull away
                <br>A spin during the second stint for #13 cost it around 40s to the Pescarolo, and with both Courages making their 2nd stop during a safety car period

                <br>#88 Creation took pole but after jumping the start it was aborted and they had to try again. #88 kept the lead, with #15 Zytek taking 2nd from #2 Audi
                <br>An early safety car meant the top 3 made their first stop, leaving #1 leading and #2 emerging first of the pit callers. #1 made its first stop under a later safety car, leaving #2 in the lead
                <br>#6 Porsche suffered a broken throttle sensor during the same SC, causing a lengthy pit stop for repairs
                <br>#16 Dyson made it up to 3rd, but contact in traffic and subsequent penalty dropped it down the order. The Zytek was pressuring the leading #2, and eventually made it past and started to pull away, until pitting during another safety car
                <br>#7 Porsche pitted from the class lead and went straight to the garage with the fuel cell leaking
                <br>Incidents and reliability issues started taking its toll, with #20 Dyson suffering a heavy crash 2.5h into the race, and sister #16 retired with an engine failure just past the 5h mark. The Zytek briefly took the lead during the 7th hour, until a puncture dropped it back down the order. That left the Creation in 3rd, but it then had its own incident, going off on some oil
                <br>Drama as the race reached 9 hours with #1 Audi pitting from 2nd with broken suspension, and retired as there wasn't time to fix it before the finish
                <br>#2 Audi thus took the win ahead of #15 Zytek and one of the ageing MG-Lolas taking 3rd

                <br>#15 Zytek and #88 Creation locked out the front row and took the early lead, as the two Audis overtook #6 Porsche which went from 3rd to 5th
                <br>#1 pitted during an early safety car just 10 min in with something loose in the footbox, dropping a lap down
                <br>The Zytek had contact with #61 Ferrari, punting it off and triggering another safety car. #2 Audi made its first stop during that safety car, with the Zytek being penalized for the incident
                <br>#7 Porsche took the lead when the leading Creation and #2 Audi pitted 1,5h into the race. by the time the Porsche pitted along with #1 it was #2 that emerged in the lead
                <br>The Creation then had a series of spins following the stop, ending in a collision between it and #2 Audi, causing both cars to spin and also delaying #6 Porsche in the process. #2 had to pit to replace a broken nose and was also penalized for the incident
                <br>#16 Dyson briefly took the lead, however it was soon passed by the Zytek, which then made a critical error pitting just as the safety car came out, when the pits were closed
                <br>#2 Audi also pitted during the safety car to top up with fuel, hoping to stretch it to the end. As the race restarted the Zytek immediately took the lead from #7 Porsche, but pitted to serve the penalty for pitting before the pit entry opened
                <br>The safety car came back out shortly after, allowing #1 to make its final stop with #2 potentially needing a splash to finish the race
                <br>On the restart #2 Audi went from 3rd to the lead, with #7 Porsche 2nd and #16 Dyson losing places to the Creation and #1 as well
                <br>#7 Porsche was pressuring the #2 Audi, but a spin proved costly as well as needing a splash to get to the finish
                <br>#2 was in maximum fuel save, and just about managed to stretch it to the finish to win, with #1 taking 2nd as others around it also had to pit for a splash

        <h2>2007 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The big news of the season was <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=65C017EB-1143-FDC9-356A552AFD502693.html" target="_blank">Peugeot returning to sportscar racing</a> with the 908 HDi FAP, competing in the Le Mans Series. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5B764705-1143-FDC9-3561936C19731BD0.html" target="_blank">Audi continued their program in the ALMS</a>, joined by <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms856.htm" target="_blank">Porsche who revealed an upgraded evolution of the RS Spyder</a>, however Porsche continuing to focus exclusively on ALMS. The new car was also run by Dyson racing, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms896.htm" target="_blank">who replaced the Lolas from 2006</a>, moving down to the P2 class.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms803.htm" target="_blank">Acura joined ALMS with a new factory effort</a> in the P2 class. For the first season they took a Courage LC75 chassis and upgraded it extensively, badging the car as the ARX-01a in the P2 class at Sebring. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms828.htm" target="_blank">Two of the teams ran the new car</a>, with the 3rd factory-supported team racing a Lola chassis, focusing purely on engine developement.
        <br>A big talking point was the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=8178E350-1143-FDC9-3524B57414741D91.html" target="_blank">lack of pace difference between the P1 and P2 cars</a> in the ALMS, with IMSA deciding not to follow the ACO in reducing the restrictor diameter by 5% for LMP2 cars, allowing them to be much closer to the P1 Audis on pace.
        <br>After winning every LMS race of the season, Pescarolo switched their focus to building a new car themselves, debuting the new Pescarolo 01 at the LMS opener at Monza. The car was able to run in both LMP1 and LMP2 depending on the engine specification, with several teams running it as customer cars.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/alms/2006/plm/plm_seriesaddress.htm" target="_blank">ALMS revealed a revised calendar</a> with 3 new events, racing at street circuits in St. Petersburg and Detroit together with the IRL, and joining Champ Car at Long Beach. The new calendar also saw the event at Road America extended to 4 hours, and the Portland race dropped off the calendar.
        <br>The <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2006lmes/lmes_506.htm" target="_blank">LMS also revealed a modified calendar</a>, returning to Monza and Silverstone, as well as a new event in Valencia in Spain. A 6th event was added later in the form of <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2006lmes/lmes_517.htm" target="_blank">Interlagos in Brazil</a>, running to 1000 Miles rather than the usual 1000 km distance. The event in Istanbul dropped off the calendar after two years.
        <br>After a slow start in 2006, the JLMC planned a steady growth by keeping the 3 races from 2006, and adding a 4th race at Fuji. The hope was that the 2007 season would see more notable entrants and bigger grids compared to the previous season.

                <br>Classes: P1, P2, GT1, GT2
                <br>Circuit Length: 6.019 km
                <br>Laps Completed: 364
                <br>Distance Covered: 2190.916 km
                <br>Number of cars entered: 34 (4 P1, 9 P2, 3 GT1, 18 GT2)
                <br>Number of cars finished: 24 (3 P1, 7 P2, 3 GT1, 11 GT2)
                <br>Pole Position: #2 Audi Sport North America, Audi R10 TDI, Frank Biela(DEU), Emanuele Pirro(ITA), Marco Werner(DEU), 1.44,974
                <br>Overall Winner: #2 Audi Sport North America, Audi R10 TDI, Frank Biela(DEU), Emanuele Pirro(ITA), Marco Werner(DEU), 12:01.14,838
                <br>P2 Winner: #26 Andretti Green Racing, Acura ARX-01a, Bryan Herta(USA), Dario Franchitti(GBR), Tony Kanaan(BRA), +6 Laps
                <br>GT1 Winner: #4 Corvette Racing, Chevrolet Corvette C6.R, Oliver Gavin(GBR), Olivier Beretta(MCO), Max Papis(ITA), +23 Laps
                <br>GT2 Winner: #62 Risi Competizione, Ferrari F430 GTC, Mika Salo(FIN), Johnny Mowlem(GBR), Jaime Melo(BRA), +34 Laps
                <br>The two Audis led the early laps ahead of #7 Porsche, with #1 taking the lead 15 min in as #2 hit traffic. #6 Porsche suffered brake issues in the first hour and dropped down the order.
                As the Audis made their first stop #2 was penalized for a pit stop infringement, and then in the 2nd hour suffered a puncture costing it 2 laps limping back to the pits, it was then penalized an hour later for speeding in the pit lane, with #1 was also penalized shortly after for contact in the pit lane with #16 Dyson.
                That left #7 Porsche in the lead, but it soon pitted with electrical issues, the team initially changing the battery, but the car lost a lot of time in the pits repeatedly for more new batteries and eventually a new alternator cable.
                #6 Porsche also suffered similar electrical issues and it too dropped a long way down with repeated visits to the pits.
                #1 Audi pitted for a routine stop at the 5h mark, but failed to start and the car dropped down the order, suffering the same issue multiple times over the following few hours.
                That left #2 back in the lead after its earlier problems, with the new #26 Acura 2nd overall and #9 Acura 3rd, until #9 slowed with electrical issues, it too dropping down the order.
                #2 made a routine stop approaching 7h, but was penalized for a pit stop infringement and held for an extra 40s.
                Following a series of safety cars #26 ended up right behind the leading #2, but over the final few hours it drifted to 6 laps down with multiple stops for small repairs as well as clearing the radiators and refilling gearbox oil, while #2 Audi cruised home to take the win

                <br>The Porsches locked out the front row, but #1 Audi hit #7 at the start, taking the lead, with #26 Acura barging its way into 2nd at T1, with #7 suffering a puncture and #6 having to make an early stop with overheating.
                #1 Audi was blamed for the incident and given a stop/go, but it set a blistering pace and soon re-took the lead from #26 which had a damaged rear wing after touching the wall.
                An SC period 40 min in saw both Audis make their first stop, but a miscommunication saw #26 stay out, being swallowed at the restart and making contact with #6 Porsche, going off.
                The Audis controlled the race from there, but the rest of the competition imploded, and after contact between one of the Dysons and #15 Lola Acura and pit cycles for the rest left the two Porsches 3rd and 4th overall behind the two Audis

                <br>#9 Acura started on Pole, but #1 Audi took the lead at the start with #7 Porsche following it int 2nd. #2 Audi was pressuring #9 throughout the first stint, but after getting past it went off and lost time in the pits with damage.
                As the leaders made their first stop #9 failed to start, dropping a lap down as #1 Audi had to stop again with a puncture. that left #7 in the lead ahead of sister #6.
                #7 Porsche was the first to make its 2nd stop, as #1 Audi went off after getting unsettled in traffic. A safety car saw #26 Acura make its 2nd stop when the pits opened, with #6 and #1 stopping a lap later.

                <br>#7 Peugeot started on pole, but went off in T1 in slightly damp conditions, handing the lead to #2 Audi. #7 eventually fell down to 5th, with the Audis holding the first 3 positions.
                An early rain shower at the hour mark made conditions difficult, but the leaders stayed on slicks as the rain didn't last long.
                Drama in the 2nd hour as #3 Audi crashed out, retiring on the spot and causing a lengthy safety car to repair the barrier.
                Another shower of rain in the 3rd hour saw #7 Peugeot briefly switch to wets, but it proved to be the wrong call as the track dried again, forcing another stop.
                #8 Peugeot hit problems in the 5th hour and pitted with suspension issues, dropping 8 laps in the garage.
                #1 Audi was having a steady race in 2nd until contact with #63 Corvette in the 7th hour forcing it to pit to fix some damaged bodywork.

                With just 3h to go #7 Peugeot suffered engine issues, and after trying to repair it in the garage, it too retired from the race.
                Rain started falling with 2 hours to go, forcing everyone to switch to wets, and as the rain intensified the safety car was deployed in the final hour, with #8 Peugeot being rolled into the garage with a gearbox issue.
                10 minutes from the end the safety car pulled in, but #1 Audi comfortably cruised home to take the win, with #8 Peugeot finishing 2nd after stopping and waiting for the finish

                <br>Peugeot again locked out the front row and controlled the opening stages, with #7 ahead until #8 took the lead a few laps in.
                #8 Peugeot maintained the lead through the first cycle of pit stops, but #7 pitted again just before the hour mark and went into the garage with a wheel bearing issue.
                After initially rejoining several laps down #7 went back in the garage and retired before the end of the 2nd hour.
                A brief rainshower in the 4th hour made conditions difficult, but the leaders stayed out on slicks. #8 maintained the lead through a myriad of safety cars to take the win, with the two factory Pescarolos ending up 2nd and 4th, either side of the LMP2 winner

                <br>#1 Audi Started on pole ahead of #7 Porsche, but #2 Audi took 2nd at the start, with the Audis leading the opening stages, as #26 Acura split the Porsches.
                The Audis made their first stop just before the hour mark, before a safety car period triggered by #9 Acura going off after contact.
                The Porsches made their first stop under the safety car, with the two Audis making a 2nd stop a lap later. However major confusion in the pit lane saw #2 Audi penalized and dropped a lap down, with #1 ending up 3rd overall.
                On the restart #1 Audi quickly re-took the lead and started to pull away. As the leaders made their last stop #1 maintained its lead as #6 Porsche suffered a puncture and had to pit again.
                #1 Audi had built a comfortable lead and was set to take the win until a gearbox issue started costing it time and eventually #7 Porsche breezed past with less than 10 min to go to take the win, with #1 ending up 2nd after fending off #6 Porsche in the closing laps as the issue became progressively worse

                <br>The Porsches locked out the front row and led the start ahead of #26 Acura, however the Audis were bouncing back from a bad qualifying with #1 taking 3rd.
                Drama as the leading #6 Porsche got tangled up in traffic and spun, handing it a stop/go penalty and the lead to #7.
                The leaders made their first stop during an early safety car, #7 maintaining the net lead as other cars stayed out to get track position. #1 Audi took over the net lead on the restart, as #6 Porsche moved into the overall lead and #2 Audi was dealt a stop/go for contact.
                #26 Acura slowed with electrical issues near the hour mark, dropping many laps down trying to fix the issue.
                #6 Porsche eventually pitted for its first stop 1h 15min in, with the safety car coming out shortly after.
                That allowed #7 Porsche and the 2 Audis to make their 2nd stop, #7 cycling to the lead.
                #2 Audi made a blinding launch at the restart to jump straight to the overall lead, as #9 Acura spun and made contact with #6 Porsche, which suffered a damaged rear wing.
                #2 Audi controlled the lead, but after heavy pressure from #7 Porsche in the closing stages the Audi cracked and #7 muscled its way past to take the win in the final minutes

                <br>#2 Audi initally took pole, but an accident earlier in the weekend saw driver Pirro declared unfit, forcing him to be replaced and the car started from the back.
                #7 Porsche inherited pole, but #1 Audi took the lead at the start. #26 Acura suffered damage after contact, forcing it to pit for repairs and a substantial penalty, the car eventually retiring due to the damage sustained.
                After fighting back to lie 2nd overall #2 Audi was involved in an incident in the 3rd hour sending it off the road, the car managed to get back to the pits but dropped many laps repairing the damage. #1 Audi also suffered damage after ending up involved in an incident ahead, forcing it too into the pits briefly for repairs.
                As the race was nearing 6h #9 Acura pitted during a lengthy safety car to fix a starter motor problem that had plagued the car throughout the race. #6 Porsche had a steady race until the 7th hour, when multiple stops to fix damage sustained in a 2nd hour incident dropped it down the order.
                In the closing hours #1 Audi briefly stretched its lead to 1 lap, but safety cars and pit cycles meant it was #7 Porsche leading after both cars had made their final stop. The gap closed up during a late safety car period, and #1 Audi fought back to take the lead on track, bringing it home to take the win

                On the restart #1 made a stunning launch to vault straight to the lead ahead of the two Porsches as #15 was swamped.
                Another safety car later in the 2nd hour saw the second round of pit stops, again the Porsches with the faster stops as #7 took the lead ahead of #1, and #6 jumped #2 until it slid off on the pit exit.
                #9 Acura was fighting back from its earlier delays, but suffered a puncture after contact with #2 Audi following a stern block, before it collided with #16 Dyson and went off and retired.
                The resulting safety car saw the third round of pit stops for the leaders, but with several cars staying out the Dysons cycled to the front split by #7 Porsche, with the Audis further back in the field.
                However the grunt of the Audi saw #1 cut through the field to take the lead, with #7 Porsche following it into 2nd.
                Another safety car in the final hour saw the leaders make their final stop, with #7 taking the lead ahead of #1. The power of the Audi meant #1 re-took the lead at the restart, however #7 Porsche maintained the pressure and they diced for the lead as darkness descended. However the Audi stayed cool and held on to take the win, with #2 finishing third after fighting back from earlier delays

        <br><a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=FD71C206-1143-FDC9-351392977909D75C.html" target="_blank">Pescarolo continued into their 2nd season</a> in the LMS with the 01, the car proving popular amongst customer teams as well, both in LMP1 and LMP2.
        <br>Porsche continued into their third season in the ALMS with the RS Spyder, with the factory team again focusing exclusively on North America. However some privateer teams brought the RS Spyder to Europe to compete in LMS and at Le Mans.
        <br>Following an encouraging first season Acura expanded their program for 2008, with 4 teams using the updated ARX-01b. AGR and Highcroft continue from 2007, with the Fernandez team returning <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B0AEAC79-1143-FDC9-3575E1276A586D0D.html" target="_blank">now also with the Acura chassis</a> after competing with a Lola the previous year. The 4th team to join the program was the newly created <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=C5E4ECC5-1143-FDC9-359C5F2558ADDDC7.html" target="_blank">de Ferran motorsports</a>.
        <br>Minor changes in the regulations for LMP1 and LMP2 <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=F8E404F6-1143-FDC9-35E52A23045BAFAA.html" target="_blank">announced by the ACO</a> to further level the performance between petrol and diesel cars, as well as increasing the gap between LMP1 and LMP2. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=22A12BD7-1143-FDC9-358CABEC79C71C1F.html" target="_blank">IMSA chose to implement some of these changes</a>, primarily to slow the P2 cars, which dominated large parts of the previous season.
        <br>ALMS focused on continuity and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=715FC471-1143-FDC9-35BBA97256B4EF93.html" target="_blank">revealed a calendar</a> featuring all the events from 2007, with only small adjustments to race lengths.

        <h2>2023 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>3 years after the announcement of the convergence between the top class in IMSA and FIA/ACO, the new LMDh cars debuted in the GTP class. Acura and Cadillac built new cars based on their previous DPi cars, with Porsche and BMW joining with all new cars. Acura and BMW chose to compete in IMSA, while Porsche and Cadillac also joined the FIA WEC.
            <br>Ferrari also joined the WEC with a new LMH, along with the ByKolles Vanwall, which had finally sorted the legal issues with the Vanwall brand. After debuting half way through 2022, Peugeot started their first full season, with Toyota and Glickenhaus also continuing with similar programs to 2022.
            <br>Isotta Fraschini also launced a new LMH, but with a very short timeline, they were rejected from a full season entry.
            <br>With Porsche and Ferrari both focusing on their Hypercar/GTP programs, resulting in potentially only Corvette running in GTE-Pro, the FIA and ACO decided to end the class at the end of 2022, leaving only a single GTE class for 2023.
            <br>WEC started a gradual expansion after conservative seasons following COVID-19, keeping the races from 2022, and adding a race in Portugal, where they previously were in 2021, as well as announcing a new event in Qatar for 2024.
            <br>IMSA made a few changes to their calendar, with Mid-Ohio and Detroit dropping out, replaced by a new event at Indianapolis.

                <br>#60 Acura led the early stages with the #25 BMW hitting trouble less than an hour in with a hybrid issue, spending several hours in the garage.
                #01 Cadillac briefly took the lead when the #60 Acura had to make several pit stops under a safety car period 2 hour in, changing the tail after suffering rear wing damage. However the Acura re-took the lead with a faster stop under another safety car an hour later.
                #7 Porsche also suffered a hybrid issue around the 6 hour mark, losing several laps changing the battery in the garage.
                Throughout the night the Acuras developed issues with the oil system, #10 requiring a short trip to the garage to replace the oil filter and oil filler cap. The #60 was having similar issues, having to make several pit stops to manage the issue while staying withing touching distance of the lead lap.
                As Sunday morning approached the #31 Cadillac slowed and went into the garage with broken suspension after contact, dropping several laps down. Soon after the remaining #6 Porsche spun off, suffering rear damage and dropping out of the lead battle as it pitted for repairs.
                Throughout Sunday morning the BMWs suffered more issues, #25 with a minor gearbox issue and #24 had brake issues requiring a visit to the garage. The #7 Porsche also suffered a broken water pipe, costing more laps.
                Drama as the #6 Porsche suffered a gearbox failure 3 hours from the end, stopping on track with smoke coming out of the rear, retiring after getting back to the pits on electric power.
                The fight for the win was mainly contested by the #60 Acura and the #01 and #02 Cadillacs, however with a series of safety cars in the closing hours, the #10 Acura went from 2 laps down to the lead lap, and it soon took the Cadillacs for 2nd, however the #60 Acura held on in the closing stages to take the win.

                <br>#50 Ferrari led from Pole as #94 Peugeot suffered a gearbox failure on the formation lap and went straight to the garage. An early SC saw the two Ferraris pit for fuel, leaving the Toyotas in the lead. On the restart #708 Glickenhaus stopped on track with electrical issues, eventually getting going again.
                1h into the race #93 Peugeot also suffered a gearbox failure and dropped down the order as it went to the garage. As the leaders made their first stop the Ferraris briefly cycled back to the front until they made their 2nd stop. The battle for 3rd towards the end of the 2nd stint was fierce between #6 Porsche and #2 Cadillac, the Porsche struggling on worn tyres. #94 suffered a hybrid issue and pulled into the garage and retired.
                #7 Toyota led until the 2nd stop, where #8 stayed out 2 more laps and came out ahead. #708 suffered more electrical issues and stopped on track, retiring from the race.
                Contact between #93 Peugeot and #4 Vanwall near the 3h mark as the FCY came out, #93 spinning and #4 having to pit with bodywork damage.
                As another FCY came out #8 Toyota was about to pit from the lead, but could only take emergency fuel as the pits were closed, having to come in again when the race went back to green, however it kept the lead. However it later lost the lead as it was saving fuel, dropping behind #7.
                Drama at the 6h mark as #51 Ferrari had contact in traffic, crashing out and suffering a puncture and substantial rear damage, dropping several laps down while in the garage.
                Vanwall had a steady race, until a suspension failure in the 7th hour, it too spending time in the garage fixing the damage.
                <br>#7 cruised home to take the win ahead of sister #8, with #50 finishing 3rd

A safety car restart during the 2nd stint saw #31 struggle on old tyres, dropping down the order until it had contact with a spinning car and then scattering debris everywhere trying to stay out before being forced to come in.
                When the leaders pitted #10 took the lead, but trying to double stint tyres it dropped down the order leaving #01 back in front. #6 Porsche suffered early issues, first diagnosing a hydraulic issue under the safety car, and then a puncture 3h in cost it time. During the 4th hour #24 BMW went off and suffered damage, and #6 slowed on track with fumes in the cockpit, as #7 Porsche suffered suspension issues and pitted for repairs.
                #01 had built a substantial lead, but a safety car at the 5h mark wiped it out with #10 taking the lead after pitting just before, with the rest stopping when the pit lane opened. #31 made it back to the lead lap, and traded places multiple times with #01 for 2nd overall until another SC, at which point #24 BMW stopped on track and retired with overheating.
                After the restart #01 struggled on old tyres and dropped from 2nd to 7th, as a bizarre incident under SC at the 7h mark saw an LMP3 car unlapping itself hit the rear of #6, both cars suffering damage. #31 took the lead as the leaders cycled through the pits, with #10 penalized for speeding.
                After a safety car during the 9th hour #01 muscled its way into the lead, with #10 following it into 2nd, dropping #31 to 3rd, however at the 9h mark #01 pitted from the lead and retired with engine failure. More drama with less than 2h to go as #60 Acura lost a wheel and stopped on track. The leaders pitted in anticipation of the SC, leaving #25 in the lead until it stopped when the pits opened and changed the brakes, with #6 taking tyres.
                On the restart #6 Porsche on new tyres took 3rd from #31, and after another SC restart with 1h to go it took 2nd from #7, pressuring #10 for the lead, banging wheels. #31 made its final stop, with #7 pitting to serve a penalty for a pit stop infringement as another SC came out. When the pits opened #10 and #6 made their final stop, with #7 also pitting for new tyres. On the restart #6 again went aggressive and took the lead, with #31 shuffled from the lead to 4th, until with 18 min to go #6 was baulked in traffic, contact with #10 ending in both cars crashing out, #7 failing to avoid it with all three cars eliminated.
                <br>That left #31 leading ahead of #25, and they controlled the pace as the race restarted with 5min left to take the win

                <br>Toyota locked out the front row, with #7 taking an early lead and #51 Ferrari briefly in 2nd until #8 re-took the place. #93 Peugeot started from the pit lane after having to change the steering column before the race. 
                The two Ferraris argued over track position in the first stint, with #50 eventually getting ahead, with the two Toyotas too swapping places before the end of the first stint. 
                As the cars cycled through the first stops, both #6 Porsche and #2 Cadillac jumped the two ferraris by not taking tyres, however both cars struggled in the second stint, with #2 having to stop again after suffering with a flat spot.
                Drama in the 2nd hour as #7 Toyota pitted from 2nd with a problem with a driveshaft torque sensor, the team forced to stop and change the parts, losing 7 laps. Problems also hit #51 Ferrari in the 3rd hour, suffering problems with the front braking system and having to make an extra stop to help the brake cooling.
                #5 Porsche slowed on track and pitted at the 4h mark, but after rejoining seemingly without problems it came back in shortly after with a power steering failure and dropped out of contention.
                #4 Vanwall suffered a brake failure and crashed out just before the 5h mark, bringing out the safety car. In the final hour #51 suffered a brake failure too, and slowed dramatically to nurse the car to the end.
                #6 Porsche looked set for 3rd place until it had to make a late splash of fuel to make it to the end, however it managed to hang on to finish ahead of the #2 Cadillac which finished 4th after running off sequence since the tyre issues earlier in the race.
                <br>Meanwhile #8 Toyota went unchallenged to take the win ahead of the #50 Ferrari

                <br>The race started in damp and cold conditions, with half the cars starting on slicks and half on wets. After multiple spins and cars struggling to keep pace with the safety car an extra formation lap was added.
                #7 Toyota started on pole, but fell back on slicks along with #3 Cadillac and the Porsches. The wet-shod two Ferraris led the early stages ahead of #2 Cadillac, until an early safety car, at which point the track had dried enough that the slick runners could catch back up.
                #7 Toyota re-took the lead followed by #6 Porsche as the wet runners all pitted. Once on slicks, the two Ferraris struggled heavily to get up to temperature, haemorrhaging time and going a lap down. #5 Porsche and #8 Toyota gradually made their way towards the front, #8 having started at the back after an accident in qualifying.
                #6 Porsche lost time during the first pit cycle, falling behind #3 Cadillac and #8 Toyota as #7 maintained the lead, however #8 suffering on worn tyres fell back behind #6.
                Drama in the 2nd hour as #3 Cadillac suffered a heavy accident after a power steering failure, the car retiring with the driver sent to the medical centre.
                #6 Porsche was holding a strong 2nd place until a complete electrical failure saw the car stop on track and retire, as at the same time #4 Vanwall went off and got stuck in the gravel.
                Problems continued for #4 Vanwall, after briefly stopping on track before driving back slowly to close the door in the 4th hour, it got tangled up in traffic and crashed out of the race.
                After pitting in the 5th hout #50 Ferrari exited the pit lane and immediately crashed out on cold tyres, it too retiring from the race.
                #7 Toyota controlled the lead through the final stints despite late pressure from sister #8, including a 5 second penalty for overtaking off the track. #5 Porsche was set for 3rd place until #51 Ferrari hunted it down and took the place on the final lap
