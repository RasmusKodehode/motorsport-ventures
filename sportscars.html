        <h1>Welcome to the world of sportscars</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The debut of the Le Mans Prototype in 1999 marked the 
        start of the modern era of sportscar racing, with the new 
        cars being able to race not only at the 24h of Le Mans, 
        but also in a new 
        championship series in America using the same 
        regulations from the ACO. Further series in Europe 
        and Asia were initially planned and some became reality, 
        leading to the creation of the FIA 
        World Endurance Championship in 2012. This led 
        to the demise of the top class in America, but after 
        the creation of the Le Mans Hypercar in 2021 and LMDh 
        in 2023 the top class of sportscar 
        racing is again shared across championships both 
        in Europe and America.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>The Cars</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the nature of the regulations, allowing manufacturers to develop road-relevant technologies several brands have built top-class sportscars to prove their strength and technology on the world stage.
            Other constructors have also built cars allowing them to compete against world-class manufacturers both as factory operations and in the hands of privateer teams.
            The following are a list of cars from every manufacturer factory team as well as every car from constructors opering their cars themselves.

        <h2>Before 1999</h2>
        <p>As Group C died out in the early 90s, leading to the end of the World Sportscar Championship at the end of 1992 and the GTP class being replaced in the IMSA GT championship after 1993, the top class increasingly consisted of smaller, slower open-cockpit prototypes with production based engines called the World Sports Car (WSC). 
        These were only moderately successful, leading ACO to open up the top class at Le Mans both to older Group C cars, but also allowing GT cars to be able to fight for the overall win as part of the new LMGT1 class. 
        In 1995 the top class became available only to WSC-cars, but the LMGT1 regulations were kept the same. 
        What manufacturers realised was that the GT1 regulations were so open that they could basically build a bespoke prototype and only make 1 road-going version to be able to race. 
        This was first exploited in 1994 when Dauer modified a Porsche 962C and created a single roadcar, allowing them to take the overall win with the Dauer 962. 
        McLaren teamed up with BMW to create the McLaren F1 GTR, which took the overall win in 1995. 
        Meanwhile Porsche, together with TWR and Joest Racing won with a WSC car in 1996 and 1997, several new manufacturers were building new GT1 cars specifically for Le Mans. 
        Porsche entered the 911 GT1 in 1996, Nissan and Panoz debuted the R391 GT1 and Esperante GTR-1 in 1997, and in 1998 Toyota joined with their purpose-built GT-One together with Mercedes with its CLK-LM. 
        At this point the open nature of the regulations were becoming ridiculous, with manufacturers building cars specifically for this class because they only needed to produce a single road-going model. 
        Since these were supposed to be GT cars, the regulations specified that they needed boot space capable of holding a standard size suitcase. 
        Mercedes had placed this space underneath the rear bodywork in a very impractical place, while Toyota managed to convince the scrutineers that because the fuel tank of the GT-One was empty during scrutineering, it could theoretically fit the required space. 
        The by now complete disregard for the intention of the regulations, combined with Mercedes wiping the field clean in the newly created FIA GT Championship to the extent that nobody else entered the class in 1999, the FIA were forced to drop the class and rethink the class-structure at Le Mans. 
        This lead to the creation of the Le Mans Prototype (LMP) and the Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype (LMGTP). 
        Cars in the old LMGT1 class could be modified to fit in the LMGTP class for closed cockpit prototypes, while the LMP class was for open cockpit cars. 
        The LMGT1 class was dropped, with the former LMGT2 class being renamed LMGTS as the top GT class, with GT3-spec cars being eligible in the new LMGT class. 
        With the introduction of these new cars, the ACO looked for opportunities to create a championship with Le Mans-style regulations. 
        After a change of ownership led to IMSA being rebranded as Professional Sports Car Racing (PSCR) in 1997 and a split leading to the creation of Grand-Am and the US Road Racing Championship and the loss of two of its key events, Don Panoz went together with PSCR to partner with the ACO to launch the American Le Mans series for 1999, first testing the format by creating the first edition of the Petit Le Mans at the newly updated Road Atlanta in 1998.
        After the success of the first running the event, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991126085346/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/quotes981105.html" target="_blank">American Le Mans Series was launched in 1999</a> with ACO's new class structure, spearheaded by the new LMP and LMGTP classes seeing multiple interested factory teams.
        For the ACO this was just the start, planning more series running Le Mans regulations both in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>1999 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Following the class restructuring from the ACO, teams running in the old LMGT1 class had a choice of class for 1999. Mercedes took the CLK-LM and updated it to LMGTP regulations, becoming the CLR. Toyota did the same, requiring only minor updates to their GT-One.
        <br>Nissan chose to modify the R390 to become the open-cockpit R391 for the LMP-class. All three decided to focus purely on Le Mans, with neither bringing their cars to the ALMS.
        <br>Porsche started work on a new car for the LMP-class. The LMP2000 was initially supposed to debut in 1999, but discussions over which engine to use delayed the project to 2000, and then it was cancelled in the spring of 1999 due to internal politics.
        <br>BMW modified their V12 LM from 1998 built for the previous year's LMP regulations into the V12 LMR to race in the new LMP class, bringing the cars to Sebring for the ALMS season opener, and competing in the remaining races after Le Mans. 
        <br>Audi joined the sportscar scene with two newly developed cars, the R8R for the LMP class, and the R8C for the LMGTP class. The R8R was designed and built by Dallara in Italy and operated with the help of Joest Racing, whereas the R8C was designed by Racing Technology Norfolk in the UK and operated by Audi Sport Team UK.
        <br>Audi brought the R8R to Sebring as preparation for Le Mans, but didn't compete in any other races that season. With the developement of the R8C starting later, that car was only sent to Le Mans.
        <br>Panoz also designed the new LMP-1 Roadster-S, a front-engined open-cockpit LMP based on the old Esperante GTR-1. It debuted at the second ALMS race at Road Atlanta and then completed the rest of the season in addition to Le Mans.
        <br>For the inaugural season of the ALMS an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991126085346/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/sched981105.html" target="_blank">8-race calendar was announced</a>, including the season opening 12h of Sebring and the 2nd running of the Petit Le Mans, with other events around circuits in North America as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991126085346/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/snd981105.html" target="_blank">new street race in San Diego</a> to finish the season.
        <br>As part of the process of expanding sportscar racing across the world, the ACO planned a non-championship Le Mans-style race in Japan to gauge the interest in Asia for an ALMS-type series. Toyota and Nissan both sent a car each to the race, but neither of the other teams chose to compete there.</p>

                    Factory teams from BMW, Toyota, Mercedes, Audi, Nissan and Panoz were present in the top category.
                    The event marred by three airborne accidents and subsequent withdrawal of Mercedes, with the #4 not taking the start after taking off first during practice and then again in the Saturday morning warm-up, and the #5 spectacularly taking off on Saturday evening. The remaining #6 was then withdrawn.
                    Toyota were the favourites to win, but the team struggled with explosive punctures, #1 retiring on Saturday evening, and the #2 crashing out heavily during the night. The #3 was catching the leader towards the end of the race, but suffered another puncture in the last hour, ending the race in 2nd.
                    BMW didn't have the fastest car, but they took the lead by having to pit less often for fuel, and having fewer mechanical issues. #17 was on couse to win but crashed out on Sunday with just a few hours to go, handing the lead and the win to the #15.
                    Nissan and Panoz struggled with reliability, while Audi didn't have the ultimate pace, but good reliability meant the two R8Rs finished 3rd and 4th

                    Toyota qualified on pole and led the early stages until its first stop, handing the lead to #23 Nissan. Shortly after #1 Toyota was handed a 1 min stop/go for overtaking under yellow, dropping a lap down.
                    Although Toyota had the advantage on pace, Nissan was able to double-stint the tyres and thus controlled the middle part of the race. However #1 Toyota was reducing the gap until the car failed to start after a scheduled stop during the 3rd hour, dropping it 3 laps down on the leading #23 Nissan as the team changed the battery.
                    #1 Toyota kept trying to fight back, but another penalty after overtaking before the line at a safety car restart during the 5th hour cost it another lap. #23 Nissan thus controlled the pace to take the win, with #1 Toyota eventually finishing 1 lap down in 2nd.

        <h2>2000 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After the scary accidents suffered by the Mercedes' at Le Mans was found to be because of a fundamental aerodynamic instability of the car, the team withdrew from racing and the CLRs never raced again. 
        <br>Nissan and Toyota both also withdrew from sportscars at the end of the year, with Toyota planning to enter F1. 
        <br>BMW entered F1 in 2000, thus the team didn't return to Le Mans for 2000. However Team Schnitzer continued racing the cars with factory support for the full ALMS Season. 
        <br>After getting up to speed in 1999, Audi revealed the open cockpit R8 derived from the R8R. The team planned a full season of ALMS, but with the new cars going back to Europe to prepare for Le Mans, the R8R was brought back to complete the events at Charlotte and Silverstone. The closed cockpit R8C was found to be less preferable to the open cockpit design, and thus shelved at the end of the season.
        <br>Cadillac joined with the new Northstar LMP with the chassis designed and built by Riley & Scott, the car debuting in the Grand-Am sanctioned 24h of Daytona. Riley & Scott operated the cars as Team Cadillac in selected ALMS races, with french team DAMS operating the cars in the Sports Racing World Cup.
        <br>Ascari launched the A410, competing at the European ALMS-rounds in addition to the Sports Racing World Cup, but the team debuted too late to get an entry for Le Mans.
        <br>ACO again restructured the classes for Le Mans, renaming the previous year's LMP class LMP900, and adding the LMP675-class for smaller, lighter prototypes. The prototypes running under Grand Am rules and the FIA Sportscar Championship rules could be modified to run in either class. The 900/675-designation refers to the minimum weight of the cars, 900 kg for the top class, 675 kg for the other.
        <br>ALMS revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991129022820/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/alms990917.html" target="_blank">an expanded calendar</a> for 2000, including new events at Charlotte and Texas. Following the the postponement of the San Diego Race in 1999 it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013112215/http://americanlemans.com/pages/news99/alms991001-2.html" target="_blank">added as the season opener</a> in 2000. Three overseas races were also included on the calendar, two of them later revealed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000303110252/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/alms000114.html" target="_blank">Silverstone and Nurburgring</a> in Europe, and the Race of a Thousand Years on New Year's Eve in Adelaide, Australia. All three were set to launch separate Le Mans Series' in 2001.
        <br>Despite the luke warm interest at the 1000km event at Fuji, the ACO scheduled another edition to give it another try.

                    Audi locked out the first 3 places in qualifying with #9 on pole as #11 Panoz completed the 2nd row.
                    The trio of Audis controlled the start as #4 Cadillac retired just 15 minutes in after catching fire, triggering an early safety car.
                    The leaders took the opportunity to make their first stop, with #11 Panoz taking the lead after stopping first ahead of #9 and #7 Audi.
                    #11 controlled the restart as the race entered the 2nd hour, but #9 kept the pressure on and eventually took the lead with #7 soon following it through.
                    #2 Cadillac went off and hit the wall later in the 2nd hour, the car limped back to the pits and went into the garage to repair the damage.
                    #9 and #7 battled for the lead as the race entered its 3rd hour, and as they cycled through the pits #7 took fuel only and rejoined in the lead.
                    Safety car later in the 3rd hour saw the leaders stop again, this time #9 took fuel only and retook the lead.
                    Drama in the 4th hour as #9 spun out and hit the wall, however it rejoined without losing the lead. later in the same hour #8 suffered a puncture and was forced to limp back to the pits, losing 3rd to #11.
                    Into the 5th hour and #1 Cadillac suffered a puncture, causing extensive damage and sending the car into the garage for lengthy repairs.
                    The leaders pitted at the end of the 6th hour, this time #7 rejoined ahead. Into the 7th hour and #2 Cadillac had a lengthy visit to the garage to repair some bent suspension.
                    Drama at the end of the 7th hour as a gearbox issue sent #9 Audi into the garage with the team replacing the entire rear end, rejoining only 4 minutes later in 4th overall. However as #11 made its next stop #9 moved back to 3rd.
                    #8 Audi suffered a puncture during the 9th hour, but managed to limp back and rejoin without losing 2nd. As the race reached 9 hours #9 suffered damage to the diffuser, making several stops for repairs and handing 3rd back to #11 Panoz.
                    Into the 11th hour #7 Audi suffered a puncture and pitted from the lead, with suspension damage forcing the car into the garage for a new rear end. As #8 cycled to the lead #11 Panoz pitted from 3rd and went into the garage with gearbox issues, dropping down the order with lengthy repairs.
                    The issues for #11 meant #7 was left in 3rd, ahead of #12 Panoz in 4th. However at the end of the 11th hour #12 went into the garage with its own gearbox issues.
                    As #11 rejoined during the 12th hour an oil leak forced the car back to the garage again immediately, spending several hours in the garage trying to fix the problems. As the race reached the half way point #12 went off and got stuck in the gravel.
                    The issues for Panoz meant #3 Cadillac cycled up to 3rd ahead of #7, but was soon relegated to 4th. Meanwhile in the 14th hour #1 Cadillac rejoined after several hours following the puncture, but a power steering failure forced it back in for more lengthy repairs before the gearbox failed exiting the pit lane.
                    More gearbox woes for #12 sent the car back to the garage in the 16th hour, #2 Cadillac also joined it in the garage with similar issues.
                    As the Audis cycled through the pits as the race reached 16 hours they took the opportunity to change the brakes, with #7 also forced to bleed the system.
                    Into the 18th hour and problems struck all three remaining Cadillacs, #2 suffered more clutch issues and went back to the garage, #3 suffered a clutch failure and a water leak, and #1 also came back to the garage with more gearbox problems.
                    With the race entering its final 4 hours #3 suffered a suspension failure and was forced to drag the car almost a full lap back to the pits, causing substantial damage. The lengthy repairs handed 4th to #16 Pescarolo Courage.
                    Drama for #11 Panoz just over 1 hour before the end, a puncture sent the car off the road at high speed, but managing to limp back to the pits for repairs before continuing.
                    The Audis cruised through since Sunday morning to secure a 1-2-3, with #8 making its final stop 30 min from the end on the way to the win, with #9 and #7 following it home.

                    First start aborted because the cars weren't lined up properly and it took 2 laps before they could get a proper start, the race then had one of the closest finishes in history with the #42 BMW on slicks in drying conditions catching the leading Audi on wets, but finished only 0,149s behind at the flag

        <h2>2001 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After not making the trip to Australia with their prototypes, BMW retired their V12 LMRs, and for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001117041000/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/Sept2000.htm#9/29/2000d" target="_blank">2001 they competed in the GT class</a> with the new V8-powered M3 GTR. 
        <br>Audi continued racing in ALMS alongside Le Mans with two factory cars, in addition they also sold customer cars to Champion Racing in ALMS and Johansson Motorsport in ELMS.
        <br>Panoz competed with the new LMP07 after debuting it at Adelaide the previous year, planning another attack on the ALMS and Le Mans.
        <br>Cadillac continued with an upgraded Northstar LMP01, focusing purely on Le Mans with 2 cars operated by DAMS, with Team Cadillac returning to the US to compete in selected ALMS events.
        <br>Bentley debuted the closed-cockpit EXP Speed 8 at Le Mans, reviving the LMGTP class which had no entrants in 2000. 
        <br>After increased interest in the MG-brand, the company set out to compete at Le Mans. The team tasked Lola with building the chassis and AER stood for the engine, with the team selecting the new LMP675 class to compete in, hoping the light weight would give them an advantage against the other factory prototypes.
        <br>Ascari continued into their 2nd season, competing again in the FIA Sportscar Championship, in addition to also taking trips to the ELMS round at Donington and Le Mans.
        <br>The dominant Dodge Vipers were retired from the GTS class as Chrysler started developement of a brand new LMP-car together with Oreca and Dallara. The new car debuted at the Donington ELMS-race, before the factory effort went to Le Mans.
        <br>After debuting at Le Mans in 2000, ALMS took on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010204223100/http://www.americanlemans.com/pages/00news/alms001113.html" target="_blank">LMP900 and LMP675 classes</a> as well in place of the general LMP-class used in 1999 and 2000.
        <br>After staging two races in Europe in 2000, ALMS organizer Professional Sports Car Racing was looking to expand and the ELMS was launched as a sister series in Europe, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001117041000/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/Sept2000.htm#9/29/2000g" target="_blank">5 races across Europe</a> including a 1000km event at Estoril. The calendar also contained optional races at Sebring and Petit Le Mans with ALMS, and the race in Adelaide with APLMS.
        <br>The APLMS were also scheduled to start in 2001 following the Race of a Thousand Years at the end of 2000, with Adelaide returning alongside a new event at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia.
        <br>ALMS presented a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001117041000/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/Sept2000.htm#9/29/2000f" target="_blank">new calendar for 2001</a> centered around the shared events at Donington and Jarama with ELMS and Adelaide and Malaysia with the APLMS. The calendar also contained a new event at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010627165159/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/111500a.htm" target="_blank">newly upgraded Mont-Tremblant</a> in Canada.
        <br>Plans were announced in September 1999 to build a new race track in Aruba. The organizer had an agreement to host the ALMS season opener in 2001, however the 4.345 km <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000124182926/http:/www.americanlemans.com/pages/news99/alms990928.html" target="_blank">Aruba International Raceway</a> was never built due to a conflict between the track promoter and the Aruban government over funding and the event was never officially on the <a href="https://us.motorsport.com/alms/news/alms-announces-2001-schedule/1841229/" target="_blank">2001 calendar</a>, with the calendar slot created for the event eventually given to Texas. The failure to comply with the agreements made with ALMS and other series it was supposed to host the organizer ended up mired in legal cases, which the Aruban government eventually lost after shutting down the plans.

                    #2 Audi qualified on pole and controlled the start ahead of sister #2, as #3 Champion Audi had a terrible start and dropped down the order.
                    #9 Holland Dome went from 4th to 2nd, as #16 Chrysler briefly took 3rd before #1 fought back, with #7 Bentley then demoting the Chrysler to 5th.
                    Heavy rain arrived 15 min into the race with #4 Johansson Audi and #5 Cadillac going off, and a pileup brought out the safety car.
                    Some of the leaders pitted for wets, but #2 Audi stayed out along with #11 Panoz and #9 Dome. However #2 then went off and had to pit with damage, and #9 also elected to stop for wets.
                    #12 Panoz and #34 MG also had to pit for repairs after going off.
                    By the time everyone had cycled through it was #7 Bentley leading ahead of #1 Audi and #11 Panoz, but as the race restarted and the track started drying, the slick-shod #11 took 2nd from from #1. After trading places in the wet and drying sections #11 started catching the leading #7 Bentley.
                    Into the 2nd hour and the leaders pitted with #1 taking inters and #11 and #7 taking fuel only. #11 Panoz rejoined in the lead but #1 soon caught it and took the lead as #33 MG gradually cycled up to 4th and was catching #7 for 3rd.
                    #1 pitted from the lead for slicks and handed the lead to #11 as #34 MG pitted with electrical issues and then a cracked exhaust.
                    #12 Panoz lost a wheel and limped back to the garage as #11 pitted and handed the lead to #7 which was rapidly being caught by #1 before taking the lead. #33 then pitted from 3rd and was delayed after going off entering the pits, with #2 taking the place before taking 2nd from #7.
                    Approaching the 2 hour mark #11 lost a wheel and limped back to the pits, with #12 also pitting as a precaution while the team diagnosed the problem.
                    As the race entered the 3rd hour rain started falling again as #12 returned to the garage with brake issues and #2 slowed and lost 2nd to #7.
                    As #1 and #8 cycled through the pits #3 Champion Audi moved past the Bentley into 4th and #2 moved back past #7 for 2nd.
                    As the rain intensified #4 Johansson Audi stopped on track and retired with electrical issues as the leaders stopped for wets before the safety car came out, with #7 cycling to 2nd ahead of #2 and #8.
                    As the race restarted into the 4th hour both Panoz' pitted and went into the garage with gearbox issues, and #2 Audi took 2nd from #7 Bentley.
                    #6 Cadillac pitted after losing a wheel and went into the garage for suspension repairs.
                    Heavy rain into the 5th hour as #7 pitted and handed 3rd to #3 Champion Audi ahead of #15 Chrysler as #34 MG aquaplaned off before stopping on track and retiring with engine issues.
                    #5 Cadillac then hit problems, going off the track twice before losing a wheel and limping back to the pits for repairs.
                    Drama as #7 Bentley stopped on track and retired with engine failure. Meanwhile #5 Cadillac was back in the garage with more bodywork and suspension damage.
                    Rain continued to fall with several cars suffering minor issues caused by water in the electrics, and around the 6h mark #33 MG pitted with a misfire and went into the garage, with #12 Panoz stopping on track shortly after, before returning to the pits after 30 min and retired with electrical issues. In the meantime sister #11 had also retired after an accident.
                    Problems then hit #3 Champion Audi as it stopped on track and retired from 3rd with electrical issues, with #8 Bentley cycling up behind the factory Audis.
                    Into the 8th hour and problems struck several cars as #8 pitted to check the engine compartment, #16 Chrysler took 3rd before pitting with a water pump failure, #17 Pescarolo Courage cycled to 3rd before going into the garage with engine issues and #33 pitted with broken headlights. The MG eventually retired with a broken oil tank.
                    That left #8 back in 3rd, before gearbox issues forced it back into the pits in the 9th hour, leaving #15 Chrysler 3rd. 
                    Drama early in the 11th hour as #2 Audi went into the garage, the team changing the rear end before rejoining, but the comfortable gap to #15 allowed it to maintain 2nd. The Chrysler then pitted and after a long stop the car retired with engine failure, leaving #8 Bentley back in 3rd.
                    As the race entered the 12th hour the track finally started to dry after several hours of persistent rain. #20 Ascari had gradually moved up the standings as cars fell out, but approaching the half way point the car stopped on track and retired.
                    As the race entered its 14th hour #6 Cadillac pitted from 4th and went into the garage with starter motor issues, another unscheduled stop later handing 4th to #16 Chrysler.
                    After spending in excess of 6 hours to repair the car #21 Ascari finally retired in the 16th hour due to the damage sustained earlier.
                    Small issues plagued #2 Audi, an off in the 12th hour where it had to get towed out of the gravel, and a puncture early in the 17th hour, but the car maintained 2nd with a big gap back to #8.
                    More issues struck leading runners across Sunday morning as #16 went into the garage, handing 4th to #6 Cadillac before that suffered a series of starter motor failures over the next few hours, dropping back down the order.
                    Into the 21st hour as the leading #1 Audi went into the garage for a new rear end before rejoining still in the lead.
                    Rain came and went in the closing hours as #6 stopped on track with clutch failure with an hour to go, only to wake up and limp to the finish as #1 Audi cruised home to take the win ahead of sister #2 and #8 Bentley.

        </p><br><br>
        <h2>2002 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi and Panoz continued their programs in ALMS, with Panoz debuting the LMP01 Evo, an updated version of the LMP-1 Roadster-S following the previous year's flawed LMP07. Panoz' and Audis also competed in the hands of privateer teams, Audi with Champion Racing, and Panoz with several teams, of note MBD who used the discarded LMP07s fitted with Mugen engines.
        <br>Cadillac continued their program racing at Le Mans as well as a partial ALMS season, debuting their new Northstar LMP02 with an all new chassis, after abandoning their previous iteration of the Riley & Scott chassis. The manufacturer also cut the ties to DAMS, running the car exclusively under the Team Cadillac banner.
        <br>Bentley continued racing at Le Mans with the EXP Speed 8 whilst developing a new car for 2003.
        <br>After unreliability plagued the effort in 2001, MG returned to Le Mans with a modified car to improve durability. The team also started selling the car to customers, racing both in ALMS and Le Mans.
        <br>Ascari shipped their cars over to the US and renamed it the KZR-1, competing in selected races like the Rolex 24 at Daytona and Sebring, before competing in Le Mans. The team also intended to race in Washington DC, but never made it there.
        <br>After finishing the project with Cadillac, Riley & Scott launced a new version of the MK III in 2001, and offered it to customers for the first year. After the bankruptcy by Reynard who owned R&S, the project was taked over by Riley Technologies and for 2002 the factory team was relaunced together with Jim Matthews Racing. They debuted at Sebring before contesting Le Mans and finishing the season with the two last ALMS rounds.
        <br>After building the C60 in 2000, for 2002 Courage joined as a factory team, competing in the FIA Sportscar Championship and Le Mans, whilst also supporting its customer Pescarolo.
        <br>After joining the prototype field in 2001 Chrysler changed their mind after the season and withdrew from sportscars. Dallara took over the cars and sold them to customers, with Oreca continuing as a privateer.
        <br>BMW meanwhile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020306213820/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/main.cfm?contents=/series/alms/contents.cfm&banner=/2001_sc_header.cfm&header=/imsa_header.htm&page=/2002/news/news02/012202e.cfm" target="_blank">announced in January the cancellation of its ALMS GT program</a> with the M3 GTR after rule changes for the LMGT category limiting its competitiveness of the controversial V8 engine.
        <br>At the end of 2001 the ALMS organizer changed its name from Professional Sports Car Racing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011113025726fw_/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/100501d.htm" target="_blank">bring back the famous IMSA name</a> it had held previously, until a change of ownership in 1997.
        <br>The ALMS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011113025726fw_/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/news/100501e.htm" target="_blank">announced an expanded calendar</a>, with new events at Road America, Washington D.C., Trois-Rivieres and Miami, and a move away from rovals that had been on the calendar in the previous years. The calendar was initially announced with longer races, with all races being at least 3-4 hours long, however most events were reverted back to the normal 2h 45min format after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020306220253/http://www.professionalsportscar.com/main.cfm?contents=/series/alms/contents.cfm&banner=/2001_sc_header.cfm&header=/imsa_header.htm&page=/2002/news/news02/010802b.cfm" target="_blank">input from TV broadcasters</a>.
        <br>After completing the final races of the ELMS in 2001 with as few as 14 cars on the grid, the 2002 season was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020209083424/http://www.autosport.com/newsitem.cfm?id=17522&series=12" target="_blank">cancelled in december</a> citing the lack of entrants and the unstable nature of the world following the events of 11th of September. Part of the problem was that the ELMS were competing with similar cars to the FIA Sportscar and GT championships, but they had to be modified to compete in the ELMS. That meand few teams chose to compete due to the resources necessary and the impracticality of competing across the different series.
        <br>With the planned debut of the APLMS in 2001 hitting trouble with both its first two rounds cancelled for various reasons, the series were abandoned due to lack of interest and also the difficulties with the global situation. The event in Malaysia was rescheduled for 2002, and when the series was abandoned it became an ALMS invitational event.

                    <br>Heavy rain at the start of the race meant a safety-car start, with the green flag after 20 min, track drying gradually

                    The event was supposed to run for a 10 year deal, but noise complaints from neighbours meant the race was only run once
                    <br>#38 Champion Audi started from the pit lane after being forced to change the flat-spotted tyres from qualifying, and then chose to refuel before the start of the race. #50 Panoz took the lead as Champion Audi tangled with the #2 factory car, earning the #2 a stop/go penalty. #50 then lost the lead during the last safety-car period when it was forced to stay out because the pit lane didn't open on time, however it had the speed to take the win on track

        <h2>2003 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi pulled out of sportscar racing after 2002 as a works team, however the cars kept racing for privateer teams. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030724235027/http:/www.imsaracing.net/imsa.cfm?h=/2003/news/header.htm&p=/2003/news/020503b.htm" target="_blank">Joest Racing</a> and Champion Racing contested ALMS, With Champion Racing joining Audi Sport Team UK and the Japanese Team Goh at Le Mans.
        <br>Panoz also pulled out as a factory team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030724235820/http:/www.imsaracing.net/imsa.cfm?h=/2003/news/header.htm&p=/2003/news/020703b.htm" target="_blank">with its two LMP01s racing under the JML Team Panoz banner</a> in both ALMS and Le Mans, however the ageing cars struggled for pace.
        <br>Bentley debuted a new car, the Speed 8, contesting the 12h of Sebring for the first time as well as Le Mans. For the 3rd season the running of the program was split between Racing Team Norfolk which had operated the cars previously, and Joest Racing who was also working with Audi.
        <br>After its most successful year of the program, Cadillac elected not to extend the project, and did not return to sportscar racing in 2003. MG too did not continue into 2003, following financial strain on the company after two years where none of their cars reached the finish. However the car lived on in the hands of privateers across the world.
        <br>Riley continued its partnership with Jim Matthews Racing, competing at Sebring and Le Mans while Riley started working on new projects.
        <br>Courage continued into 2003, racing its C60 against Pescarolo's now upgraded C60 Evo whilst also developing the C65 which debuted at Le Mans in the LMP675 class.
        <br>Lister produced its first prototype for 2003, but for the first year chose to focus on Le Mans where the car made its debut, before entering the 1000 km race at Le Mans at the end of the year.
        <br>Having run a GMS-designed car in the FIA Sportscar Championship since 2000, for 2003 Automotive Durango constructed their own car. The PM02 again competed in the FIA Sportscar Championship, but this yeat the team also went to Le Mans for the first time.
        <br>For 2003 Ascari moved its focus back to Europe, competing in the FIA Sportscar Championship, but they didn't return to Le Mans or ALMS and the program ended following the 2003 season.
        <br><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2114431/new-events-mexico-europe-highlight-2003-alms-schedule/" target="_blank">ALMS revealed the new calendar for 2003</a> with a new race in Mexico City, as well as a planned race in Europe in May. However the European race was soon <a href="https://au.motorsport.com/alms/news/2003-schedule-finalized/1011711/" target="_blank">abandoned after a suitable venue couldn't be agreed on</a>. The format of the Road America race was also changed from 500 Miles to the standard 2h 45min.
        <br>Meanwhile, two years on from the failed ELMS, ACO tried again to plan its own sportscar championship in Europe. To prepare for this, it set up another experimental race at La Sarthe to check the interest before committing to the new LMES in 2004.

                    #16 Dyson took the lead by jumping the start, after giving back the positions the car suffered electrical issues and retired just a few laps into the race
                    <br>#1 Joest Audi had a torrid day, first going off and hitting the wall causing extensive damage, later failing to start after a pit stop requiring a new battery, before going off the road again and getting stuck in the gravel
                    <br>There was drama as the #30 Intersport went off and crashed into a flatbed truck recovering the #20 Dyson which had gone off earlier, the accident caused extensive damage and the car retired
                    <br>#88 Prodrive led GTS until contact with the #1 Joest car in T1 sent it off the road, however it managed to come back and take the win. The #24 Porsche won GT despite suffering damage very early in the race after contact with the Rafanelli car ripped the passenger side door off and causing extensive damage to the side
                    <br>#38 Champion Audi had a big lead after all the problems for Joest, but it too suffered a slow stop with a battery change as the car refused to start, and it later had to make an extra stop after dislodging the nose
                    <br>The Panoz-cars were running reliably, with the #10 taking 2nd behind the Champion car, while the #11 ended up 4th after suffering with power steering failure

        <h2>2004 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The ACO announced changes in the class structure for 2004, with LMP900 and LMP675 being replaced by LMP1 and LMP2. LMP900 and LMGTP-cars moved to LMP1, and LMP675 cars could be converted to either of the new classes. Rule changes were also announced for LMP1 with overhang limited and the floor structure changed to limit downforce and make the cars less likely to take off. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms292.htm" target="_blank">IMSA announced that they would delay enforcing these new rules in ALMS,</a> allowing both new LMP1 and LMP2 cars and old LMP900 and LMP675 cars to compete in what became the P1 and P2 class. This allowed Dyson racing to continue using their LMP675 MG-Lolas, moving them into the P1 class.
        <br>After the announcement of the 1000 km of Le Mans preview race in 2003, ACO launched the new Le Mans Endurance Series, racing on classic European circuits and bringing back the classic 1000 km/6 hour format from the old World Sportscar Championship days. Having learned from the ELMS in 2001, the new series attracted several teams from the FIA Sportscar championship and FIA GT championship, with the lack of interest forcing the FIA Sportscar Championship to end following the 2003 season.
        <br>Audi started work on a new car to succeed the R8, which would ultimately debut in 2006. Meanwhile the Joest Team ended their program in ALMS, leaving only Champion Racing competing in the US. In Europe, Team Goh and Audi Sport UK also operated Audis in the new LMES, with Team UK also making the trip to Sebring.
        <br>After winning Le Mans in the 3rd year of the program, Bentley ended their sportscar program and didn't return. Panoz too elected not to return in the top class with the LMP01, instead focusing on their GT-class program.
        <br>Having originally developed the 02S in 2002, Reynard went bankrupt and International Racing Management took over the project and renamed it the DBA 03S for 2003. In 2004 the production was taken over by Zytek, with the 2003 chassis sold to Creation Autosportif and the new cars were <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2004lemans/lemans348.htm" target="_blank">badged as the Zytek 04S</a> and <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2004lemans/lemans317.htm" target="_blank">campaigned by the Zytek factory team</a>. Both cars were entered in the LMES, with Zytek only running a limited program while Creation brought the 2003-car to the two final ALMS rounds as well.
        <br>Lister went into their 2nd season with the Storm LMP, starting at Le Mans before finishing the LMES season.
        <br>Having been a Courage customer for several years, Henri Pescarolo's team took their 2003 car and updated it themselves, improving the aero and switching out the Peugeot engine for a new Judd V10. They debuted <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2004lemans/lemans372.htm" target="_blank">the new Pescarolo C60</a> at Monza, competing in LMES as well as bringing 2 cars to Le Mans.
        <br>Meanwhile Courage switched to the LMP2 class to compete with the new C65 that debuted the year before.
        <br>With the new LMP1 regulations the R&S MK III C was becoming outdated, and with the factory switching its focus to the Rolex Sportscar Series DP class, the ALMS and Le Mans program was reduced to supporting the remaining customers.
        <br>As the new LMP1 regulations made older LMP900 obsolete, Durango switched its focus back to single seaters and didn't return to sportscars in 2004.
        <br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060629012254/http:/motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=140336&FS=ALMS" target="_blank">ALMS announced their new calendar for 2004</a>, with a focus on making sure all events could be run following cancellations and replacements in the last few years. The calendar included a return to Mid-Ohio and Portland, as well as a new event at Lime Rock Park. Laguna Seca also became the season finale, with the race extended to 4 hours.
        <br>For its first season LMES <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2003lmes/lmes_075.htm" target="_blank">revealed a 4 round calendar</a> across 4 legendary circuits around Europe, visiting Monza, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Spa.

                    A patch of oil caused both the #8 Team UK and #2 Champion Audis to crash out around 2 hours in. Both cars could continue, but McNish in the #8 was briefly knocked unconscious and was deemed unfit to continue, leaving only Biela and Kaffer to complete the rest of the race
                    <br>#88 Team UK Audi led from pole ahead of the #5 Team Goh car which lost time replacing the ECU early, however the #88 then lost time in the night serving a penalty for overtaking under yellow flags and then colliding with the #64 Corvette. The #5 also lost time in the night fixing a misfire during an SC-period that had plagued the car for a few hours
                    <br>The #88 Audi kept the lead until it had to pit in the morning to repair a suspension issue, and with 7 minutes spent in the garage, the #5 Team Goh Audi took over the lead. Despite a few moments like an early pit stop to change flat-spotted tyres after a heavy lock-up and a brief fire during refuelling, they held on to take the win despite withstanding pressure from the faster #88 breathing down its neck

                    The two Lamborghinis were withdrawn after several suspension failures in practice, the Bucknum Pilbeam was withdrawn due to its repeated struggles with engine reliability, and the #67 Porsche failed to take the start after crashing out during qualifying
                    <br>Dyson again had pole position and kept the lead until the 2nd round of stops, when the Champion Audi took fuel only and came out in the lead. However, he later went off with a puncture and lost the lead to the #16 car, which went on to take the win

        <h2>2005 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>With the ageing Audi R8 still being competitive, the ACO announced that 2005 would be the last year that cars built to the old LMP900 rules would be permitted to race, and the cars were also handicapped with more ballast and less power than the newer LMP1 machines. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms446.htm" target="_blank">Older generation LMP900 cars would still be allowed to race in ALMS</a>, with IMSA not enforcing the new rules yet, allowing older cars to compete alongside newer LMP1 cars.
        <br>The FIA and ACO also revised the classes for GT-cars, with LMGTS and LMGT replaced by LMGT1 and LMGT2. The new classes were designed to more tightly control and balance the cars, with specific laptime requirements set. The new structure meant new cars would have to be homologated by the FIA before being allowed to compete.
        <br>In the US, Champion Racing continued racing their two R8s, also competing at Le Mans. Audi Sport Team UK and Team Goh chose not to continue beyond 2004, with Team Oreca taking over one of the R8s to compete in the LMES and Le Mans.
        <br>After racing the C60 in 2004, Pescarolo <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans621.htm" target="_blank">updated the car for 2005</a> to the new hybrid regulations that meant the car avoided the handicaps imposed on the old LMP900 cars. The team raced 1 of the new C60 Hybrids in the LMES, with a 2nd car joining for Le Mans.
        <br>Courage's factory team moved back to LMP1 for 2005, racing an upgraded C60 for the new hybrid regulations.
        <br>The Zytek factory team expanded their program for 2005 after new <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans596.htm" target="_blank">investment from Essex Invest</a>. The team used the 2004-car with the new restrictions from the ACO, competing in the full LMES season as well as <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms676.htm" target="_blank">selected ALMS races</a>.
        <br>With the sponsorship from Essex Invest moving to Zytek, it left Lister with a reduced budget for 2005. The team started at Spa, but by the Silverstone round the team debuted a new Hybrid version of the car in the hope that it would be more competitive.
        <br>Porsche <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms630.htm" target="_blank">announced its return to sportscar racing</a> with the new RS Spyder, built for the LMP2 regulations. Porsche partnered with Penske Motorsport to run the cars, testing throughout 2005 and initially planning to debut at Petit Le Mans before that was delayed to the final round at Laguna Seca.
        <br>In the GT-classes, new cars were introduced with the new regulations. Corvette replaced the old C5-R with the new C6.R, and Aston Martin joined with the brand new DBR9. There was also controversy as <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms584.htm" target="_blank">IMSA allowed Maserati to run in the GT1 clas in ALMS with the MC12</a>, despite the car not being built to LMGT1 spec. The decision drew criticism from ACO and from several of the teams, with <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms611.htm" target="_blank">Aston Martin protesting the car at the first round in Sebring</a>.
        <br>The schedule for the 24h of Le Mans was adjusted after discussions between IMSA and the ACO who were finding it challenging to schedule races early in the season with the mandatory test day being a month before the race forcing both ALMS and LMES to effectively take a long break to allow teams to race at Le Mans. In 2005 the test day was moved to 2 weeks before the race, allowing more flexibility for ALMS to schedule more races early in the season.
        <br>IMSA focused on concistency in the <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2004alms/alms479.htm" target="_blank">ALMS calendar</a>, keeping all events from 2004 as well as adding the return of a sprint event at Road Atlanta. they also took advantage of the Le Mans test day being moved to reschedule Mid-Ohio to May, before Le Mans.
        <br>LMES also focused on steady growth after a successful first season, keeping the 4 events from 2004, and <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2005lmes/lmes_261.htm" target="_blank">adding a fifth round at the new Istanbul Park</a>.

                    <br>Zytek lost the lead after being forced off the track while lapping a slower car, and was forced to pit to clear out the radiators
                    <br>#2 Audi moved up to second, but it then dropped back with a penalty after making contact and punting the Maserati off into the gravel
                    <br>Rain started falling with 40 min to go, and when it got heavier in the last 10 minutes both the Zytek and the P2 leading Courage went off
                    <br>The rain could not stop Dyson Racing taking a 1-2, with the #16 taking the win, followed by the sister #20
                    <br>There was a big scrap for the P2 class win, but the #10 Courage was disqualified in the last hour after one of the drivers exceeded the maximum driver time in the car, leading to the #8 Courage taking the win despite going off in the rain late in the race

                    Exeptionally hot temperatures throughout the race hitting 30+ degrees, causing big challenges keeping cars and drivers cool
                    <br>The two Pescarolos led the early stages, but already 1h in they started suffering issues, with the #17 damaging the suspension after contact, and the #16 suffered gearbox issues at the 2h mark. More technical and mechanical issues dropped them further down the order on Saturday evening
                    <br>The #2 Champion Audi took the lead following the Pescarolos' gremlins with the Audis lying 1-2-3, however on cold tyres after a safety car-period the #2 went off the road and suffered front end damage, costing it time needing repairs in the garage
                    <br>The #4 Team Oreca Audi also suffered issues in the night, twice being rolled into the garage for suspension repairs
                    <br>#2 Audi went off again on Sunday morning after a tyre failure, getting stuck in the gravel and then losing more time being repaired in the garage
                    <br>#17 Pescarolo suffered a myriad of issues on Sunday morning, ending in retirement after crashing out and suffering extensive damage
                    <br>By Sunday lunchtime the #16 Pescarolo was back in 2nd and catching the leading Audi at a pace that it could catch the lead by the end of the race. However, with less that 2h to go it was starting to overheat, with the team briefly rolling it back to the garage to clean the radiators and cruising to 2nd place
                    <br>This meant the #3 Champion Audi could control the pace after a flawless run to take the win, with Tom Kristensen taking a record-breaking 7th Le Mans win

                    <br>After the leading crews made their first stops during a safety car period, the #16 Dyson muscled its way past the #1 to take the lead
                    <br>Drama in the last hour as the #20 Dyson was involved in a pile-up and crashed out, the #16 pitted from the lead before the safety car was called. However, the car wouldn't restart, and the #1 Audi re-took the lead
                    <br>#2 Audi was also involved in the pile-up, but it suffered minimal damage and was able to fix it without losing a lot of time
                    <br>There was confusion as the race was restarted with a truck still on the track, luckily all the cars avoided it, and the safety car came back out very quickly as the #20 retired with gearbox failure, dropping oil on the track. However there was still time for the #2 to take the lead, but race control deemed that the yellow flags were waived despite neither the drivers nor the team saw them, forcing them to swap the places back
                    <br>When the race restarted the delayed #16 got back on the lead lap to try to chase down the Audis, until the gear linkage broke and the car retired in the last 10 minutes. The two Audis battled for the lead, with #1 holding on to take the win

                    <br>The #4 Audi and #7 DBA fought a strategic battle, with the #7 taking the lead at the third round of stops when the Audi got stuck in traffic, only for the Audi to strike back at the next cycle when the DBA had a slow tyre change
                    <br>#15 Zytek kept closing gradually on the leaders throughout the race, and in the final stint caught and passed the #7 DBA on the second attempt following a trip through the gravel, and then catching and passing the leading #4 Audi in the closing laps to take the win

                    The race was supposed to run for 2h 45min, but a fuel shortage caused by hurricane Katrina forced the race to be shortened
                    <br>The two Dysons locked out the front row with #20 on pole, but #16 took the lead at the start, with the #20 losing out to both Audis in the first stint, before pitting early with a slow puncture
                    <br>#1 Audi and #16 scrapped for the lead, ending in a collision in the final corner after banging wheels. #16 ended up off the road, while #1 continued
                    <br>However #16 fought back to take the lead at the last stop, taking only fuel when the #1 Audi also took 2 tyres. The Dyson held off the Audi in the sprint to the flag to take the win
                    <br>#31 Porsche led GT2, but lost a wheel and went off on the final lap. However, it had a big enough lead that it couldn't be caught, and was thus given the win

                    <br>The #16 briefly held the lead following the first corner melee, but it too had to pit with the brake pedal going to the floor, compounded by a stop/go for a pit stop infringement
                    <br>The #20 Dyson was lying 2nd until it suffered a turbo issue, dropping it too down the order. That left the #2 Audi cruising alone out front, with almost every other car suffering substantial time losses
                    <br>The safety car was deployed in the 4th hour as the grass in T1 had caught fire, with a fire engine deployed to put it out
                    <br>The #1 Audi tried to catch up after falling many laps down following the first lap crash, but continued to suffer, first getting a puncture and later colliding with the #58 Aston, breaking the suspension and costing more time

                    <br>However #17 lost the lead after a brief spin and the first stop, where a misted visor forced a driver change

        <h2>2006 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>With the ACO outlawing old LMP900 cars from Le Mans, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans730.htm" target="_blank">Audi revealed the R10 TDI</a> to replace the R8. That also coincided with Audi returning as a factory team, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms764.htm" target="_blank">cooperating with Champion Racing in ALMS with team Joest running the cars at Le Mans</a>. With IMSA still allowing older cars to compete, it also gave them the opportunity to take a single R8 on a farewell tour over the first few ALMS rounds while the R10s were testing for Le Mans. News also came in 2005 that <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2005lemans/lemans685.htm" target="_blank">Peugeot would also join LMP1 in 2007</a> with their own diesel-powered prototype.
        <br>After debuting in the ALMS season finale in 2005, Porsche went into the first full season with the RS Spyder. The team focused on competing solely in ALMS, as the ACO did not welcome factory teams in the LMP2 class at Le Mans. 
        <br>Pescarolo continued racing in Europe with its C60 Hybrid after a successful 2005-season, again <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2006lemans/lemans784.htm" target="_blank">fielding 1 car for the LMS season</a>, and a second car for Le Mans.
        <br>Courage debuted a new car, the LC70 and formed a partnership with Mugen who delivered engines for the factory team. The car was also sold to customers.
        <br>Zytek continued into their 3rd season, but were forced to <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2006lemans/lemans756.htm" target="_blank">update the car for the Hybrid LMP1 rules</a>. The team again competed in the LMS with the updated 06S, before bringing the car across the Atlantic for the final ALMS rounds.
        <br>After running the DBA 03S in 2004 and 2005 the Hybrid regulations forced a redesign, the team partnered with KWM to create the CA06/H with the latest Judd engine, completing the LMS, Le Mans and the final two rounds in ALMS.
        <br>Lister went into 2006 with plans to complete the full LMS season with the Storm LMP Hybrid, but it announced at Le Mans that development of the car would cease and the team skipped Nurburgring to bring the final updates to Donington.
        <br>Giovanni Lavaggi announced his intention to build his own Le Mans prototype and become the first driver-constructor in modern history. The Lavaggi LS1 made its debut at Jarama for the LMS finale.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2005alms/alms684.htm" target="_blank">ALMS released a new calendar</a>, with Sonoma and the spring race at Road Atlanta being replaced by a race at the new Miller Motorsports Park in Utah, and a new street circuit in Houston Texas, run together with Champ Car.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2005lmes/lmes_387.htm" target="_blank">LMES continued with a 5-race calendar</a> with a few shuffled dates, as well as switching the British round from Silverstone to Donington Park. The series also underwent a slight rebranding, and became known simply as the Le Mans Series.
        <br>Work conducted by the people behind Team Goh culminated in the <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/other/2005other/other999_023.htm", target="_blank">debut of the new ACO-backed Japan Le Mans Challenge</a>, organizing 3 1000 km races in Japan, in an effort to get japanese teams interested in international sportscar racing.

                    Pole sitting #2 Audi suffered issues in the warm-up, and had to start from the pit lane after replacing a heat exchanger before the start. That left #1 on pole, ahead of the two Porsches
                    <br>Both Porsches suffered problems in the opening hours with #7 briefly stopping on track, and the #6 was forced into the pits to replace a broken alternator. #7 later had to pit for lengthy repairs to a broken radiator and steering issues
                    <br>#1 Audi led the early stages despite a spin after getting confused in traffic with #2 catching up to lie 2nd. However #1 then retired with an overheating engine around the 4 hour mark
                    <br>#2 was left alone out front, but it wasn't plain sailing as it suffered issues in the pits at the half way point, struggling to remove a loose wheel as well as having to clean the fuel filter
                    <br>The Porsches continued to suffer reliability issues, with #7 retiring with a broken driveshaft 5 hours from the end, and #6 retired in the final hour with an oil leak
                    <br>Despite the issues encountered, #2 Audi cruised home to take the win

                    #17 Pescarolo started on pole as the race started in damp but drying conditions, however it dropped a few places after contact on the first lap as the #13 Courage, and then #9 Creation took the lead on superior wet tyres
                    <br>The Pescarolo soon fought back to take the lead on lap 4, however the drying conditions meant the leaders soon pitted for slicks
                    <br>#9 Creation re-took the lead after everyone had pitted, but the Pescarolo was right behind and they traded places until the 2nd round of pit stops, where the Pescarolo ended up with a substantial lead after taking only fuel, with Creation also taking tyres
                    <br>Following this the #9 Creation slowed and retired with a gearbox issue, as 1h 45min in race control announced the race would finish at 4 hours due to a fuel shortage at the track
                    <br>This left the #17 Pescarolo out front, and it cruised to take the win

                    #9 Creation was withdrawn from the race after a crash in practice, with the #17 Pescarolo also involved in an incident, forcing it to start from the pit lane
                    <br>#5 Courage took pole in a wet qualifying and led at the start, however a big pile-up at the top of Raidillion eliminated 6 cars and triggered an immediate safety car, before the red flag came out on lap 2 with stricken cars and debris scattered across the track
                    <br>The race restarted 50 minutes later, but another accident under the safety car meant another delay before the race got going
                    <br>As the race restarted, the #12 Courage pressured the leaders, going from 3rd to the lead in a single lap and starting to pull away. However #17 Pescarolo was hounding its way through the field and was 2nd by the end of the 2nd hour
                    <br>After catching the leading Courage #17 Pescarolo took the lead in the 3rd hour as they fought through traffic, with the lead growing significantly as they both pitted during a safety car period where the #12 Courage suffered electrical issues at pit exit

                    The Audis locked out the front row ahead of the two Pescarolos, and #7 led the early stages, although they traded places in the first few hours, with the #16 Pescarolo briefly holding 2nd after an early pit stop under safety car put it out of sequence
                    <br>The race quickly became a stranglehold by the Audis, having more pace and better fuel economy than the Pescarolos.
                    <br>Problems started during the 3rd hour for the leading #7 Audi, first having to make an extra pit stop after rubber dislodged the windscreen, and an hour later it was in the garage to replace the fuel injectors, which dropped it down the order
                    <br>The two Pescarolos also suffered issues in the early night hours, #16 had a lengthy stay in the garage trying to fix some electrical issues, and #17 went off and got stuck in the gravel
                    <br>#7 Audi was back in the garage approaching 9h in after suffering contact breaking a wishbone, and after rejoining briefly it came back to the garage with floor damage
                    <br>#8 Audi had a comfortable lead, but nearing the half way point there was drama as it was wheeled into the garage with gearbox issues, however it managed to exit the pits still leading. It soon had to pit again with a slow puncture, but the time loss was minimal
                    <br>As Sunday morning dawned the leading #8 had another scare, with a marshal stopping it at the end of the pit lane, forcing it to be rolled back to the pit box after one of the headlamps had failed. Shortly afterwards #7 slowed on track again, spending yet more time in the garage with a broken turbocharger
                    <br>During the rest of Sunday the cars ran reliably, with #8 cruising home to take the win ahead of the #17 Pescarolo and the recovering #7 Audi

                    The Dysons locked out the front row ahead of the Audis and Porsches, with #20 taking the lead. Contact behind between #7 Porsche and #2 Audi cost the Porsche track position
                    <br>#7 Porsche tangled with #9 Lola, causing significant damage to the side, the car retiring after returning to the garage. The incident brought out the safety car, and the leaders made their first stops, with the Audis beating the #20 Dyson out, #2 taking the lead
                    <br>As the safety car pulled in the #16 Dyson suffered a puncture, dropping out of the leading fight

                    #12 Courage had pole with #2 Zytek alongside, and #9 Creation in 3rd, with all three trading places in the opening laps, #12 leading at the end of the first lap
                    <br>#17 Pescarolo briefly took 2nd in the opening laps, but was penalized with a stop/go for clipping a corner marker, dropping down the order
                    <br>The top 5 continued to scrap for positions, #5 Courage and #10 Creation moving up and #12 Courage losing places, with the Creations running 1-2 until the first round of pit stops
                    <br>#17 Pescarolo was catching up with the leaders scrapping for position, and after taking fuel only at the first stop it emerged in the lead ahead of #5 Courage
                    <br>The two Creations made an early 2nd stop during a safety car period, with #9 suffering a slow stop, allowing #10 to take the lead once the rest of the leaders made their 2nd stops by the end of the 2nd hour, at which point #5 Courage dropped out with gearbox issues
                    <br>#2 Zytek had fought back by the 3rd stint, overtaking the Pescarolo for 2nd, and then #10 Creation for the lead before pitting for its 3rd stop. The Pescarolo then took the lead when the #10 Creation pitted, emerging 3rd but quickly dispatching #2 Zytek for 2nd, although the pair traded places again on track and in the pits
                    <br>#17 pitted and dropped to 2nd, but caught the leading #2 until it made its stop, where it was delayed by a sticking wheel, before dropping out with a slipping clutch
                    <br>That left the Pescarolo with a comfortable lead, cruising to the win ahead of #10 and #9 Creations

                    <br>The leading #16 and #2 Audi traded places, with #2 prevailing and opening up a lead, allowing it to take tyres at its first stop and maintain the lead despite massive pressure on the outlap from #16 which took fuel only
                    <br>#2 Audi then made its 2nd stop at the earliest opportunity, taking fuel only and staying in front by the time the rest had pitted. It stayed at the front to take the win, despite coming under late pressure on worn tyres from #20 Dyson

                    <br>#2 Audi also pitted during the safety car to top up with fuel, hoping to stretch it to the end. As the race restarted the Zytek immediately took the lead from #7 Porsche, but pitted to serve the penalty for pitting before the pit entry opened
                    <br>The safety car came back out shortly after, allowing #1 to make its final stop with #2 potentially needing a splash to finish the race

        <h2>2007 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The big news of the season was <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=65C017EB-1143-FDC9-356A552AFD502693.html" target="_blank">Peugeot returning to sportscar racing</a> with the 908 HDi FAP, competing in the Le Mans Series and Le Mans with 2 cars.
        <br><a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5B764705-1143-FDC9-3561936C19731BD0.html" target="_blank">Audi continued their program in the ALMS</a>, joined by Porsche who revealed an <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms856.htm" target="_blank">upgraded evolution of the RS Spyder</a>, however Porsche continuing to focus exclusively on ALMS. The new car was also run by Dyson racing, <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms896.htm" target="_blank">who replaced the Lolas from 2006</a>, moving down to the P2 class.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms803.htm" target="_blank">Acura joined ALMS with a new factory effort</a> in the P2 class. For the first season they took a Courage LC75 chassis and upgraded it extensively, badging the car as the ARX-01a in the P2 class at Sebring. <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/alms/2006alms/alms828.htm" target="_blank">Two of the teams ran the new car</a>, with the 3rd factory-supported team racing a Lola chassis, focusing purely on engine developement.
        <br>A big talking point was the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=8178E350-1143-FDC9-3524B57414741D91.html" target="_blank">lack of pace difference between the P1 and P2 cars</a> in the ALMS, with IMSA deciding not to follow the ACO in reducing the restrictor diameter by 5% for LMP2 cars, allowing them to be much closer to the P1 Audis on pace.
        <br>After winning every LMS race of the season, Pescarolo switched their focus to building a new car themselves, debuting the new Pescarolo 01 at the LMS opener at Monza. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=65DFB5DA-1143-FDC9-35482CF7F89CE211.html" target="_blank">2 factory operated cars</a> completed the LMS season and Le Mans, with several other teams running the car as customers in both LMP1 and LMP2.
        <br>Courage continued into the 2nd year with the LC70, but after running Mugen engines the year before, in 2007 they switched to AER powerplants.
        <br>With the new LMP1 regulations Zytek had to build an all new chassis, the 07S. After 3 years as a factory team Zytek switched their focus to offering factory support to <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2006lemans/lemans928.htm" target="_blank">customer teams operating the new car</a>, with several customers both in LMP1 and LMP2.
        <br>Creation Autosportif constructed the new CA07 for the new LMP1 regulations, with the factory team debuting the new car at Le Mans in addition to supporting customers running the car in LMP2.
        <br>Lavaggi went into its first full season as a tiny factory operation, intending to compete in the LMS whilst continuing to develop the car.
        <br>With the older Hybrid prototypes outlawed and development of the Storm ceased, Lister went into 2007 with the goal of building a new car around the Pescarolo 01. They hired Peter Elleray to lead the aero development team and a switch to Judd engines was planned for the new Lister Judd. However after delays the project was cancelled due to financial issues.
        <br><a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/alms/2006/plm/plm_seriesaddress.htm" target="_blank">ALMS revealed a revised calendar</a> with 3 new events, racing at street circuits in St. Petersburg and Detroit together with the IRL, and joining Champ Car at Long Beach. The new calendar also saw the event at Road America extended to 4 hours, and the Portland race dropped off the calendar.
        <br>The <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2006lmes/lmes_506.htm" target="_blank">LMS also revealed a modified calendar</a>, returning to Monza and Silverstone, as well as a new event in Valencia in Spain. A 6th event was added later in the form of <a href="http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lmes/2006lmes/lmes_517.htm" target="_blank">Interlagos in Brazil</a>, running to 1000 Miles rather than the usual 1000 km distance. The event in Istanbul dropped off the calendar after two years.
        <br>After a slow start in 2006, the JLMC planned a steady growth by keeping the 3 races from 2006, and adding a 4th race at Fuji. The hope was that the 2007 season would see more notable entrants and bigger grids compared to the previous season.

                    The two Audis led the early laps ahead of #7 Porsche, with #1 taking the lead 15 min in as #2 hit traffic. #6 Porsche suffered brake issues in the first hour and dropped down the order.
                    As the Audis made their first stop #2 was penalized for a pit stop infringement, and then in the 2nd hour suffered a puncture costing it 2 laps limping back to the pits, it was then penalized an hour later for speeding in the pit lane, with #1 was also penalized shortly after for contact in the pit lane with #16 Dyson.
                    That left #7 Porsche in the lead, but it soon pitted with electrical issues, the team initially changing the battery, but the car lost a lot of time in the pits repeatedly for more new batteries and eventually a new alternator cable.
                    #6 Porsche also suffered similar electrical issues and it too dropped a long way down with repeated visits to the pits.
                    #1 Audi pitted for a routine stop at the 5h mark, but failed to start and the car dropped down the order, suffering the same issue multiple times over the following few hours.
                    That left #2 back in the lead after its earlier problems, with the new #26 Acura 2nd overall and #9 Acura 3rd, until #9 slowed with electrical issues, it too dropping down the order.
                    #2 made a routine stop approaching 7h, but was penalized for a pit stop infringement and held for an extra 40s.
                    Following a series of safety cars #26 ended up right behind the leading #2, but over the final few hours it drifted to 6 laps down with multiple stops for small repairs as well as clearing the radiators and refilling gearbox oil, while #2 Audi cruised home to take the win

                    The Porsches locked out the front row, but #1 Audi hit #7 at the start, taking the lead, with #26 Acura barging its way into 2nd at T1, with #7 suffering a puncture and #6 having to make an early stop with overheating.
                    #1 Audi was blamed for the incident and given a stop/go, but it set a blistering pace and soon re-took the lead from #26 which had a damaged rear wing after touching the wall.
                    An SC period 40 min in saw both Audis make their first stop, but a miscommunication saw #26 stay out, being swallowed at the restart and making contact with #6 Porsche, going off.
                    The Audis controlled the race from there, but the rest of the competition imploded, and after contact between one of the Dysons and #15 Lola Acura and pit cycles for the rest left the two Porsches 3rd and 4th overall behind the two Audis

                    Porsche locked out the front row, but #7 made a bad start and with the field bunched up #2 Audi went from 8th to the lead ahead of #26 Acura.

                    #7 Peugeot started on pole, but went off in T1 in slightly damp conditions, handing the lead to #2 Audi. #7 eventually fell down to 5th, with the Audis holding the first 3 positions.
                    An early rain shower at the hour mark made conditions difficult, but the leaders stayed on slicks as the rain didn't last long.
                    Drama in the 2nd hour as #3 Audi crashed out, retiring on the spot and causing a lengthy safety car to repair the barrier.
                    Another shower of rain in the 3rd hour saw #7 Peugeot briefly switch to wets, but it proved to be the wrong call as the track dried again, forcing another stop.
                    #8 Peugeot hit problems in the 5th hour and pitted with suspension issues, dropping 8 laps in the garage.
                    #1 Audi was having a steady race in 2nd until contact with #63 Corvette in the 7th hour forcing it to pit to fix some damaged bodywork.
                    #2 Audi dominated and pulled out a substantial lead, but on Sunday morning it dramatically crashed out after losing a wheel and retired on the spot.
                    With just 3h to go #7 Peugeot suffered engine issues, and after trying to repair it in the garage, it too retired from the race.
                    Rain started falling with 2 hours to go, forcing everyone to switch to wets, and as the rain intensified the safety car was deployed in the final hour, with #8 Peugeot being rolled into the garage with a gearbox issue.
                    10 minutes from the end the safety car pulled in, but #1 Audi comfortably cruised home to take the win, with #8 Peugeot finishing 2nd after stopping and waiting for the finish

                    The Porsches locked out the front row and led the start ahead of #26 Acura, however the Audis were bouncing back from a bad qualifying with #1 taking 3rd.
                    Drama as the leading #6 Porsche got tangled up in traffic and spun, handing it a stop/go penalty and the lead to #7.
                    The leaders made their first stop during an early safety car, #7 maintaining the net lead as other cars stayed out to get track position. #1 Audi took over the net lead on the restart, as #6 Porsche moved into the overall lead and #2 Audi was dealt a stop/go for contact.
                    #26 Acura slowed with electrical issues near the hour mark, dropping many laps down trying to fix the issue.
                    #6 Porsche eventually pitted for its first stop 1h 15min in, with the safety car coming out shortly after.
                    That allowed #7 Porsche and the 2 Audis to make their 2nd stop, #7 cycling to the lead.
                    #2 Audi made a blinding launch at the restart to jump straight to the overall lead, as #9 Acura spun and made contact with #6 Porsche, which suffered a damaged rear wing.
                    #2 Audi controlled the lead, but after heavy pressure from #7 Porsche in the closing stages the Audi cracked and #7 muscled its way past to take the win in the final minutes

                    The Peugeots locked out the front row and led the opening stages, with #7 pulling out a substantial lead in the opening stint.
                    With some cars pitting under an early safety car, by the time the Peugeots made their first stop #7 emerged in 4th, gradually cycling back to the front and pulling a gap that meant it could maintain the lead by the time it made its 2nd stop.
                    #17 Pescarolo pitted at the start of the 3rd hour with a starter motor problem, the car retiring in the garage.
                    #8 Peugeot suffered a puncture in the 4th hour, dropping more time and falling back to 4th overall.
                    Trying to fight back #8 was forced to stop in the final hour to fix some loose bodywork, but the damage couldn't be repaired in time to finish the race.
                    #7 Peugeot remained unchallenged and took the win, followed by the remaining #16 Pescarolo

                    #2 Audi initally took pole, but an accident earlier in the weekend saw driver Pirro declared unfit, forcing him to be replaced and the car started from the back.
                    #7 Porsche inherited pole, but #1 Audi took the lead at the start. #26 Acura suffered damage after contact, forcing it to pit for repairs and a substantial penalty, the car eventually retiring due to the damage sustained.
                    After fighting back to lie 2nd overall #2 Audi was involved in an incident in the 3rd hour sending it off the road, the car managed to get back to the pits but dropped many laps repairing the damage. #1 Audi also suffered damage after ending up involved in an incident ahead, forcing it too into the pits briefly for repairs.
                    As the race was nearing 6h #9 Acura pitted during a lengthy safety car to fix a starter motor problem that had plagued the car throughout the race. #6 Porsche had a steady race until the 7th hour, when multiple stops to fix damage sustained in a 2nd hour incident dropped it down the order.
                    In the closing hours #1 Audi briefly stretched its lead to 1 lap, but safety cars and pit cycles meant it was #7 Porsche leading after both cars had made their final stop. The gap closed up during a late safety car period, and #1 Audi fought back to take the lead on track, bringing it home to take the win

                    Porsche locked out the front row and led the start as both Acuras spun in T1. After a short safety car period #1 Audi put pressure on the leading Porsches, and eventually took the lead in traffic.
                    The leaders made their first stop during another safety car later in the first hour, with the Porsches jumping ahead of the Audis as #2 was penalized for a pit stop infringement, and #15 Lola Acura stayed out and took the lead.
                    On the restart #1 made a stunning launch to vault straight to the lead ahead of the two Porsches as #15 was swamped.
                    Another safety car later in the 2nd hour saw the second round of pit stops, again the Porsches with the faster stops as #7 took the lead ahead of #1, and #6 jumped #2 until it slid off on the pit exit.
                    #9 Acura was fighting back from its earlier delays, but suffered a puncture after contact with #2 Audi following a stern block, before it collided with #16 Dyson and went off and retired.
                    The resulting safety car saw the third round of pit stops for the leaders, but with several cars staying out the Dysons cycled to the front split by #7 Porsche, with the Audis further back in the field.
                    However the grunt of the Audi saw #1 cut through the field to take the lead, with #7 Porsche following it into 2nd.
                    Another safety car in the final hour saw the leaders make their final stop, with #7 taking the lead ahead of #1. The power of the Audi meant #1 re-took the lead at the restart, however #7 Porsche maintained the pressure and they diced for the lead as darkness descended. However the Audi stayed cool and held on to take the win, with #2 finishing third after fighting back from earlier delays

        </p><br><br>
        <h2>2008 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Audi expanded their program for the third season with the R10, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=AE87690E-1143-FDC9-3563073345F02B00.html" target="_blank">competing in ALMS</a> as well as in <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=C0C00840-1143-FDC9-35430F8C8524104E.html" target="_blank">the LMS</a>. Peugeot also continued for a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=1CD6893A-1143-FDC9-355C317332B0BAB2.html" target="_blank">full season in LMS</a>, but they also joined ALMS at Sebring and Petit Le Mans.
        <br><a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=FD71C206-1143-FDC9-351392977909D75C.html" target="_blank">Pescarolo continued into their 2nd season</a> in the LMS with the 01, the car proving popular amongst customer teams as well, both in LMP1 and LMP2.
        <br>In 2007 Oreca bought Courage with the goal to develop a new car for 2009. In 2008 the Oreca team ran 2 modified LC70s badged as Courage-Orecas.
        <br>Creation Autosportif went into their 2nd season with the CA07, partnering with AIM to get upgraded Judd engines. The team completed the LMS season and Le Mans with two cars at most events.
        <br>A new constructor in the form of Epsilon Euskadi joined with a new car, completing the LMS season and gaining a late 2nd entry for Le Mans.
        <br>With the aging S101 having raced successfully with privateers since 2001, Dome built a new car for 2008, the Dome S102. The team brought the car to Le Mans for its debut, hoping to generate interest to sell the car to customers.
        <br>After repeated engine failures forced Lavaggi to reduce their program, and for 2008 the team replaced their Ford units with AER twin-turbo V8s. Due to the global financial crisis many of the team's sponsors had left the project and the team was now operating on a shoestring budget. Nevertheless the team continued on, continuing to compete in the LMS.
        <br>Porsche continued into their third season in the ALMS with the RS Spyder, with the factory team again focusing exclusively on North America. The team continued to operate 2 cars for the ALMS season, but facing a championship fight against Acura a third car was scrambled with people from the IndyCar crew to help the effort for the final 2 rounds. For the first time privateer teams also brought the RS Spyder to Europe to compete in LMS and at Le Mans.
        <br>Following an encouraging first season Acura expanded their program for 2008, with 4 teams using the updated ARX-01b. AGR and Highcroft continue from 2007, with the Fernandez team returning <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B0AEAC79-1143-FDC9-3575E1276A586D0D.html" target="_blank">now also with the Acura chassis</a> after competing with a Lola the previous year. The 4th team to join the program was the newly created <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=C5E4ECC5-1143-FDC9-359C5F2558ADDDC7.html" target="_blank">de Ferran motorsports</a>, debuting in Utah.
        <br>Minor changes in the regulations for LMP1 and LMP2 <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=F8E404F6-1143-FDC9-35E52A23045BAFAA.html" target="_blank">announced by the ACO</a> to further level the performance between petrol and diesel cars, as well as increasing the gap between LMP1 and LMP2. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=22A12BD7-1143-FDC9-358CABEC79C71C1F.html" target="_blank">IMSA chose to implement some of these changes</a>, primarily to slow the P2 cars, which dominated large parts of the previous season.
        <br>ALMS focused on continuity and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=715FC471-1143-FDC9-35BBA97256B4EF93.html" target="_blank">revealed a calendar</a> featuring all the events from 2007, with only small adjustments to race lengths.
        <br>Meanwhile <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=21864A38-1143-FDC9-350A415F947876C8.html" target="_blank">LMS featured a modified calendar</a>, with the event in Valencia moving to Barcelona, and the overseas round in Brazil removed.
        <br>After two dire seasons of the JLMC, with lacklustre grids and few interested teams, the series was cancelled after the ACO briefly took control of it, with the focus instead shifting to create a new series known as the Asian Le Mans Series, with an <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=E5F8287F-1143-FDC9-3513C8BAE37CF880.html" target="_blank">test event planned in Shanghai</a> at the end of the year.

                    #1 Audi qualified on pole ahead of #07 Peugeot, with the Peugeot taking the lead at the start. #1 Audi made contact with a GT car in the opening hour, with the leaders pitting under the resulting safety car and #1 was penalized for the incident.
                    #07 Peugeot maintained the lead ahead of #2 Audi and #26 Acura. Problems struck #6 Porsche as the race hit 1h, an oil leak and overheating eventually proving terminal.
                    #2 Audi was pressuring the leading Peugeot, but repeated offs with braking issues costing the car places, and handed the podium places to #26 Acura and #7 Porsche. However by the time the leaders had made their 2nd stop #1 Audi had fought back to take 2nd behind the leading Peugeot.
                    As the race approached 3 hours drama struck #07 Peugeot, pitting from the lead with hydraulic issues and dropping several laps down after multiple lengthy stops do fix a broken hydraulic pump.
                    The two Audis took over the lead, until #2 pitted with a turbo failure as the race reached half way, and with #1 too pitting shortly after the #7 Porsche resumed the lead.
                    Problems for #1 Audi started to show itself as the race went into its 8th hour, making a lengthy stop to repair a bent suspension arm, and later stopping again to replace the front brakes.
                    #26 Acura was trying to fight back after pace struggles and a timing error resulting in a lengthy safety car, until a stop in the 8th hour with water temperature issues proved costly.
                    #2 Audi was mired in bad luck, a brief off in the 10th hour forced it to pit for bodywork repairs.
                    #07 Peugeot was recovering from its earlier delays, until a wheel bearing issue in the 11th hour delayed it again. At the same time #26 Acura pitted and retired, with the water temperature issues proving terminal.
                    #7 Porsche controlled the closing hours of the race to take the win, with #15 Acura initially finishing 2nd until a broken airbox resulted in the car being disqualified. That promoted #20 Dyson to 2nd, with #1 Audi taking the final podium position

                    #2 Audi qualified on pole, ahead of #7 Porsche and #9 Acura. The start was delayed after #007 broke down and forcing an extra formation lap.
                    #2 Audi controlled the lead at the start ahead of #7 Porsche as #26 Acura barged its way into 3rd, until a costly spin in the early laps dropped it a lap down. The leaders made their first stop under safety car after 45min, with #7 Porsche taking only fuel and gaining track position ahead of #2 Audi. #1 Audi had a lengthy stop, replacing the rear end and dropping a lap down.
                    Another safety car 1h 10min in saw #1 Audi and #6 Porsche make a 2nd stop for tyres, both down the order after earlier issues. The leaders stayed out, all able to go the distance on just 1 stop.
                    On the restart #2 Audi pressured #7 and muscled its way into the lead, as #15 Acura and #1 Audi made contact, #15 going off and #1 forced to pit with damage which proved terminal. #7 Porsche fought back to re-take the lead as #2 got stuck in traffic, as another incident prompted another late-race safety car.
                    The race finally restarted with 2 min left, and #2 Audi used the mighty torque to take the lead and won the race ahead of #7, with #9 Acura finishing 3rd despite late pressure from #6 Porsche

                    Peugeot locked out the front row ahead of #1 Audi. #8 controlled the lead at the start, with the Audi barging its way into 2nd until #7 Peugeot re-took the position after pressuring #1.
                    The leaders made their first stop under safety car, with #1 Audi taking fuel only and cycling to the lead.
                    The Audi maintained the lead throughout the 2nd stint despite intense pressure from the pair of Peugeots, with #8 Moving into 2nd as the race reached the hour mark.
                    Shortly after contact forced #8 Peugeot into the garage for repairs, dropping several laps down.
                    #7 Peugeot had several moments including a brief off trying to catch #1, until the leading Audi pitted with a slow puncture. #1 ended up back in the garage later in the 2nd hour following a broken alternator belt.
                    That left #7 Peugeot in the lead ahead of #2 Audi, with the Peugeot opening up a substantial gap.
                    Problems continued for #8 as the race neared the 4h mark, going back into the garage after contact.
                    #7 Peugeot controlled the closing stages despite concern about damage to the headlight, and it took the win followed by #2 Audi.

                    #7 Porsche qualified on pole ahead of #15 Acura, however it was #6 Porsche taking the lead at the start with #9 Acura also in the mix.
                    #2 Audi was moving up the order, taking 4th from #9, and after an early safety car it took 3rd from #15 and started catching the Porsches.
                    After moving past #7 into 2nd and pressuring the leading #6, #2 Audi made its only stop of the race. #6 Porsche pitted from the lead a few laps later and rejoined comfortably in front. #7 made its stop a lap later, but taking only 2 tyres it emerged ahead of them both, and eventually cycled to the front after the rest of the leaders had pitted.
                    The Audi started fighting back, taking 2nd on the restart and eventually catching and taking the lead from #7 Porsche as they hit traffic.
                    After another safety car #1 Audi was also moving up the order taking 2nd behind sister #2, and they duly controlled the gap to finish 1-2.
                    Meanwhile a later stop under the safety car saw #9 Acura on fresher tyres catching and passing both Porsches in the closing stages do finish 3rd.

                    Drama for Audi before the start with #2 losing fuel pressure and stopping on the way to the grid, starting from the pit lane after being recovered back to the pits.
                    Peugeot locked out the front row and led the start ahead of #1 Audi, with the Peugeots pulling out an early lead.
                    #1 Audi struggled with tyre temps in the opening stages and pitted during an early safety car, however after the restart contact sent the car into a sizeable accident, briefly getting airbourne. The car managed to get back to the pits, but the extensive damage dropped the car several laps down.
                    The Peugeots made their first stop under the resulting safety car, with #2 Audi briefly taking the lead until it pitted near the end of the first hour.
                    #7 Peugeot slowed on track in the 2nd hour, a broken driveshaft after its 2nd stop forcing the car into the garage.
                    #16 Pescarolo was running 3rd until a brake failure saw the car crash out during the 4th hour, retiring from the race.
                    As the race reached the 4h mark a suspension failure pitched #5 Courage into an enormous accident, barrel rolling across the track and almost wiping out #1 Audi, scattering debris all over the track.
                    The resulting safety car saw #2 Audi cycle to the lead, and as the race restarted it fought hard to stay ahead of #8 Peugeot.
                    In the intense fight the Peugeot overtook traffic under waved yellow, and subsequently was handed a stop/go penalty. However the Audi had a miscommunication, and with #8 diving into T1 the cars made contact, with the Audi suffering a puncture.
                    That allowed #8 Peugeot to serve its penalty and rejoin and take the win, with disappointment for Audi as #2 finished 2nd and Pescarolo bringing #17 home in 3rd.

                    #8 Peugeot qualified on pole ahead of #1 Audi, with the other Peugeot and Audi filling the 2nd row.
                    The race started with an extra formation lap under safety car after an accident for #46 on the formation lap, with #8 Peugeot leading the start.
                    #1 Audi initially lost time and came under pressure from #7, but after a lock up from the Peugeot #1 started catching the leading #8.
                    The two Peugeots stopped first at the end of the opening hour, but the order remained the same after the Audis pitted 2 laps later. #1 Audi and #7 Peugeot tangled while fighting for 2nd at the start of the 2nd hour, the Audi suffering a puncture and forced to make another stop, rejoining 3rd.
                    The Peugeots made their 2nd stop later in the 2nd hour, but #8 refused to start and lost a place to #7 which cycled to the lead once #1 Audi made its stop under safety car shortly after.
                    Drama at the start of the 3rd hour as #8 Peugeot and #1 Audi made contact in traffic whilst battling for 2nd, #8 crashing out and retiring on the spot with the Audi ending up in the garage with a puncture and broken suspension.
                    #1 Audi rejoined and made another stop still under the resulting safety car, but ignoring the red light at the pit exit resulted in a 3min stop/go.
                    After all that it was #7 Peugeot leading ahead of #2 Audi, with the Peugeot cruising home to take the win as #2 Audi was involved in a late incident in traffic, escaping unscathed to finish 2nd.

                    #7 Porsche qualified on pole ahead of #15 Acura, with the new #66 Acura starting last after changing tyres before the race.
                    The Audis stormed to the front from 5th and 7th on the grid, joined by the #37 Intersport which went from 10th on the grid to the lead in the opening laps, with all three cars scrapping for position.
                    #37 started to fade a little after the first few laps, losing the lead to #1 Audi, and bringing the Porsches and Acuras back in the mix, eventually spinning while fighting #7 for 3rd.
                    The two Audis and made their first stop under an early safety car, with #6 Porsche also stopping after an off-road excursion.
                    #7 Porsche cycled to the lead, but on the restart #15 Acura went for the lead, but #9 and #26 Acuras tangled behind them with #9 breaking the suspension and losing time in the garage. #7 Porsche made its first stop under the resulting safety car, leaving #15 Acura in the lead ahead of #66.
                    The Audis were fighting back, #2 moving up to 2nd and pressuring the leading #15 Acura.
                    The two remaining Acuras stretched the first stint as long as possible, with #15 stopping after 1h 10min, with #66 following it a lap later.
                    That left #2 Audi in the lead ahead of #1, with #7 Porsche 3rd. Contact between #20 Dyson and #15 Acura caused damage to the latter as #2 Audi made its 2nd stop, stalling and losing time exiting the pits.
                    #1 stopped a lap later, and when #7 Porsche pitted from the lead #1 was leading ahead of #7 and #2 Audi.
                    Audi split the strategy in the last stint, with #1 stopping from the lead for a splash, leaving #7 in the lead and #2 2nd but fuel saving.
                    #66 Acura was moving up the order, briefly taking the lead before making its 2nd stop. Drama for the Audis as #2 suffered a puncture and spun out of 2nd, eliminated from the fight for the win, and shortly after #1 collided in traffic and retired with broken suspension.
                    That left #7 Porsche out front to take the win, ahead of sister #6 and #66 Acura.

                    The trio of Peugeots qualified in front and controlled the start with the Audis following in 4th, 5th and 7th, with #2 Audi briefly taking 3rd from #7 on the opening lap.
                    The Peugeots started to pull away, with #8 leading until a gearbox issue forced it into the garage in the 3rd hour. At the same time #9 was also forced to make an extra stop to change the nose after a headlight failed.
                    That left #2 Audi in the lead, having made fewer pit stops and spent less time in the pits. However Peugeot fought back, and #7 took the lead as the race reached 4 hours with #2 demoted to 3rd by #9 late in the 5th hour.
                    #9 then took the lead from #7 in the 6th hour, but an hour later it went off and got stuck in the gravel. Forced to be rescued out it handed the lead to #7 and #2 went into 2nd.
                    Going into the 10th hour #8 suffered more issues, going back in the garage with starter motor issues.
                    Drama as all three Peugeots visited the garage in the 13th hour, all three getting temperature warnings and stopping to clear the radiators.
                    #2 Audi briefly took the lead as the problems unfolded for Peugeot, but #7 quickly cycled back to the lead as #2 made its next scheduled stop.
                    Rain started falling early in the 14th hour, with #8 and #9 initially pitting for inters. as the rain intensified the rest of the leaders pitted for wets, with #8 and #9 forced to pit again for wets.
                    The extra stop for #9 Peugeot gifted 3rd place to #3 Audi.
                    The rain handed the advantage to Audi, with #2 moving into the lead in the 15th hour. #9 Peugeot moved back past #3 into 3rd as the race moved into its 16th hour, where #16 Pescarolo retired with engine failure.
                    Peugeot started experimenting with downforce setup on #8, and as the track started drying in the 19th hour #7 pitted for a new rear with a different downforce level.
                    The track continued to dry, and in the 20th hour #3 and #1 Audi pitted for inters. however #1 struggled, spinning and then slowing, limping back to the garage with clutch issues.
                    The rest of the leaders gradually switched to inters over the course of the next hour, before #1 Audi switched to slicks. The rest followed, but #8 went back into the garage for a brief stop to clear the radiators. #3 Audi was in at the same time, it too having its radiators cleared.
                    Shortly after #8 went off and hit the wall, after being pulled out it returned to the pits for replacement bodywork. Rain started falling again with just over 1 hour to go, with #2 stopping for inters. #7 meanwhile stuck to slicks, with heavy rain on half the track and the rest dry.
                    #1 Audi spun out in the final hour, getting stuck in the gravel and having to be pulled out.
                    #7 pitted again to try wets, but a loose wheel forced it go come back in, losing any hope of the win.
                    #2 Audi made its last stop with 13 minutes to go, and duly cruised home to take a famous win with Peugeot bringing home #7 and #9 to complete the podium.

                    #9 Acura qualified on pole ahead of team mate #66, with the Porsches filling the 2nd row.
                    #9 initially led the start as #66 went off, but #6 quickly muscled its way into the lead with #1 Audi following it through.
                    As the leaders hit traffic #1 Audi took the lead, and sister #2 soon followed it into 2nd. However soon after #2 spun off and dropped down to 5th, but started working its way back up.
                    #9 and #66 Acuras had more contact in the opening stint, with both cars suffering damage and #66 handed a penalty.
                    #66 then suffered more issues at its first stop, struggling with the driver change and the car refusing to start.
                    #2 suffered more issues at its first stop, struggling with damage in the first stint it had a longer stop for some repairs and then being delayed by a penalty.
                    Drama as shortly after making its first stop #1 Audi collided with #008, the Audi suffering extensive damage and losing many laps with repairs.
                    The Porsches made their first stop under the resulting safety car, but confusion saw #6 missing the entry first time around, with #7 and #20 Dyson jumping it. #9 and #26 Acuras also made another stop later during the lengthy safety car to top up with fuel.
                    Another safety car after another accident soon after saw #15 Acura make its final stop, but the rest of the leaders stayed out, trying to finish the race with an enormous final stint.
                    #9 Acura was moving up the order, going from 4th at the restart to 2nd before another brief safety car, and then pressuring #7 Porsche for the lead.
                    Despite an off track moment #9 kept reducing the gap to the leader, and in the final 2 minutes it went through to take the win, with #7 spinning off and finished 2nd. #6 Porsche finished 3rd despite a late penalty after contact with #20 Dyson.

                    #66 Acura qualified on pole alongside sister #9. The start was waved off as the cars were not properly lined up, forcing them to do another formation lap. When the cars took the start a lap later the two Acuras controlled the lead, as the Audis were moving up the order with #2 taking 3rd and starting to pressure the leaders. #2 Audi soon took the lead, with #1 also moving up the field, eventually slotting in 2nd behind #2.
                    #26 Acura pitted with broken suspension following contact with one of the Porsches, dropping several laps down.
                    #1 Audi then got tangled up in traffic, spinnig and losing a place to #66, but quickly rejoining and re-taking 2nd.
                    A safety car came out 50 minutes in with the leaders making their first stop, with #2 maintaining the lead ahead of #66 and #1. On the restart #1 Audi immediately grabbed 2nd, with #7 Porsche also moving past #66 a few laps later.
                    A third safety car came out with just over 1 hour to go, with the leaders making their 2nd stop. However there was drama as #66 Acura  left with the fuel rig still attached, the car came to a stop and retired in a blazing fire. The refueller was sent to hospital and the clean-up process forced the field to continue running under a lengthy safety car period.
                    #2 maintained the lead by not taking new tyres, with #7 Porsche jumping #1 to lie 2nd. However as the field restarted #7 was quickly disposed by #1, and as the Audis pulled away the fight for 3rd was between the two Porsches and #9 and #15 Acuras.
                    The Audis controlled the closing stages to take a dominant win, with #7 finishing 3rd after a big scrap with #9 Acura, after the Acura survived a big sideways moment.

                    #2 Audi qualified on pole alongside #26 Acura, with #1 and #15 Acura filling the 2nd row.
                    #2 led the start as #1 joined it in 2nd, with #37 Intersport barging its way into 3rd. #66 Acura got tangled up in traffic and went off, bringing out an early safety car. The car made it back to the pits, but dropped several laps down with substantial damage.
                    The Audis controlled the restart, with #26 Acura moving back past #15 for 4th.
                    After exiting the pits #66 Acura again tangled in traffic, sending #40 off and bringing out another safety car.
                    The leaders took the opportunity to make their first stop, except #7 Porsche which cycled to the front, as #9 Acura emerged first of the pit-callers.
                    After pitting earlier under the previous safety car, #37 Intersport stormed into the lead as the race restarted, only for another safety car to come out immediately.
                    The Audis started their climb back up, moving past #9 Acura to lie 3rd and 4th, eventually moving past #7 Porsche and #37 Intersport. #7 stretched its fuel to 1h 20min before making its first stop, along with #37 which dropped further down the order.
                    That left the two Audis in front ahead of #15 Acura, with the Audis maintaining the lead through the 2nd round of pit stops as #15 and #7 scrapped for 3rd until the Porsche made its 2nd stop.
                    At that point #26 Acura had taken 3rd from #15, with the two making their 3rd stop before a safety car came out and allowed the rest of the leaders to cycle through their stops. #2 maintained the lead, but #26 moved into 2nd ahead of #1.
                    Another safety car with 50 min to go saw the leaders make their final stop, except #9 and #15 Acuras, trying to make it to the end and cycling to the lead, with #26 and #6 also beating the Audis.
                    Drama as #15 Acura suffered a suspension failure and went off, triggering another safety car. The race restarted with #9 leading ahead of #26, with both Audis immediately demoting #6 Porsche to 5th. The Audis then started catching the leaders, with #2 moving past both of them, and #26 Acura also made it through to demote #9 to 3rd.
                    However shortly after #26 tangled in traffic and went off, retiring from the race and bringing out another late safety car.
                    That left #9 Acura back in 2nd, but as the race restarted with 3 min left #1 Audi took 2nd, with the Audis controlling the final laps to win ahead of #9.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row with the Audis only 4th and 5th behind #10 Charouz. The Peugeots controlled the opening stages with #7 leading, as #2 Audi moved into 3rd.
                    As the leaders hit traffic #8 took the lead, with #1 Audi eventually also getting past #10 into 4th.
                    Peugeot maintained the lead through the first stop, but #7 re-took the lead after #8 lost time in traffic.
                    #17 Pescarolo hit problems as the race reached the hour mark, initially a suspected puncture was soon diagnosed as a driveshaft failure.
                    Following the first stops #8 ended up back in the lead by the time the cars had made their 2nd stop.
                    #16 Pescarolo suffered a multitude of problems, inexplicably stopping on track during the 3rd hour before restarting the car and driving away. Later the car was forced to pit with a puncture before a suspension failure sent the car off into the gravel, with the car retiring with additional floor damage.
                    The Audis briefly scrapped for position as they cycled through their 4th stop with #2 staying ahead, however #1 took third after the final stop only to pit for tyres 3 laps from the end.
                    The Peugeots remained unchallenged with #8 taking the win ahead of #7, with #2 Audi ending up 3rd.

                    The increased speeds of the cars saw the track breaking up during practice, forcing the organizer to make temporary repairs for race day.
                    #1 Audi qualified on pole ahead of #2 Audi, #7 Porsche and #9 Acura. The two Audis controlled the opening stages until #1 hit traffic and #2 took the lead, with #9, #26 and #15 Acuras all scrapping for 4th overall.
                    A safety car 45 min in saw the leaders make their first stop, with #7 Porsche taking the lead as #2 Audi nosed into the pit wall leaving the stop.
                    As the race restarted the Audis pressured #7, which eventually lost out and dropped to 3rd, also coming under pressure from #26 Acura.
                    Another safety car with 1h 10 min to go saw most of the leaders make their 2nd stop, Audi initially maintained the lead but #1 Audi and #7 Porsche came back in towards the end of the safety car to top up with fuel and hope to go to the end.
                    That left #26 Acura leading having not stopped at all, ahead of #2 Audi, #66 Acura and #1 Audi.
                    #2 Audi was pushing hard, taking the lead and trying to build a gap until stopping for a splash and handing the lead back to #26, until it made its final stop and left #66 Acura in the lead, having stopped around the beginning of the last safety car.
                    With #66 Acura and #1 Audi desperately saving fuel #2 Audi caught back up, taking both of them for the lead and going on to take the win.
                    Drama in the closing stages as #7 Porsche suffered issues with the fuel rig and was forced to make a splash just 1 min from the end, before running out of fuel on the final lap. #66 was trying to hold on but it too ran out of juice on the last lap, handing 2nd overall to #1 Audi, and 3rd to #9 Acura.

                    The rest stayed out, with #15 Acura resuming 3rd until a suspension failure took it out of contention.
                    #9 and #66 was scrapping for position, and #66 took the lead as #1 Audi and #7 Porsche were fighting for 3rd.

                    #7 Porsche then tangled in traffic and was handed a stop/go, leaving #9 Acura 2nd ahead of #1 Audi.
                    #26 Acura held off the competition to take the win ahead of #9, as #1 Audi finished 3rd but got disqualified after the race after being found underweight. That promoted #66 to an all Acura podium.

                    #15 Acura went off late in the 7th hour, it limped back to the pits but retired with the damage sustained.
                    #07 Peugeot and #1 Audi pitted early in the 9th hour, and shortly after a huge accident between #30 Intersport and #46, with #26 Acura collected the debris and went off and retired.
                    All three leaders pitted during the safety car, with #2 Audi cycling to the front.
                    However #07 Peugeot took the lead at the restart, with #1 also going through to take 2nd from #2.
                    After a tough scrap with the Peugeot #1 Audi took the lead as the race entered its 10th hour, and controlled the closing stages to take the win despite sustained pressure from #07, with #2 Audi finishing 3rd.

                    Acura locked out the front row with #9 qualifying on pole ahead of #15, followed by #7 Porsche. #5 Porsche started at the back following a tyre change after qualifying.
                    #9 controlled the start as #66 Acura rocketed up to 2nd. After an early safety car #6 Porsche hit #26 Acura at the restart, the Porsche suffering front end damage.
                    A littany of safety cars throughout the first hour saw the leaders gradually make their first stop, leaving #66 in the lead ahead of #2 Audi, both of whom hadn't stopped.
                    As the race restarted into the 2nd hour #2 Audi took the lead until it made its first stop, handing the lead back to #66. Another safety car saw the remaining #66 Acura make its first stop, with #6 Porsche cycling to the lead ahead of sister #5.
                    #9 Acura started to suffer power steering issues, dropping out of contention with repeated stops to try to diagnose the problem caused in the electrics.
                    The leaders were cycling through their 2nd stop as the race reached 2 hours, leaving #7 Porsche leading ahead of #26 Acura. Another safety car in the 3rd hour saw #7 still leading ahead of #15 and #66 Acuras, but at the restart #15 was shuffled back, leaving #66 2nd ahead of #1 Audi. All three scrapped for the lead, and as #7 briefly went off #1 made a move on #66 and went from 3rd to the lead.
                    #1 and #66 continued fighting for the lead until #1 made its 2nd stop. More pit stops saw #6 Porsche cycle to the lead as the race entered its final hour, but went off immediately at the restart, bringing out another safety car.
                    That left #26 Acura ahead of #1 and #2 Audis, but the Audis ganged up on the Acura, with #1 going straight to the lead and #2 following it into 2nd. However after another safety car #2 took the lead at the restart, as #26 and #66 battled for 3rd, with #66 taking the position.
                    #2 Audi controlled the closing stages to take the win ahead of #1, with #26 Acura finishing third after barging its way back past #66 and sustaining massive pressure to the end.

        <h2>2009 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>Following record-breaking speed in 2008 the ACO adjusted the technical regulations for LMP1 and LMP2 to slow the cars down and continue to equalize the performance between diesel and petrol-powered cars. IMSA finally implemented the full ACO regulations to differentiate LMP1 and LMP2, having deliberately kept the classes closer the 2 previous years.
        <br>After competing on all fronts in 2008, and following the impact of the global economic crisis, for 2009 <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=0719B256-1143-FDC9-35417A820E4F6D56.html" target="_blank">Audi scaled back to just competing in selected events</a>, predominantly the major endurance events in Sebring, Le Mans and Petit Le Mans. Team Joest took over the whole operation, leaving Champion Racing behind. They also brought in a new car in the form of the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=F1ADF2B5-1143-FDC9-35E44B5CC683F76A.html" target="_blank">R15</a> to replace the outgoing R10.
        <br>Peugeot also <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5C2916E6-1143-FDC9-350107FA35A2248A.html" target="_blank">scaled back their involvement</a>, going into their third year with the 908. In late 2008 they also revealed a modified hybrid version of the car <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5D7E72C3-1143-FDC9-350977F90571810C.html" target="_blank">called the 908 HY</a>, but they never planned to race it.
        <br>After 3 years of success in the ALMS Porsche ended the factory program, leaving the RS Spyder in hands of privateers.
        <br>Acura continued its project in the US, after running for 2 years in LMP2 with the ARX-01, for 2009 they debuted the ARX-02 in the LMP1 class. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=1011254C-1143-FDC9-3593E7252C16FDB6.html" target="_blank">Highcroft Racing and de Ferran Motorsports</a> took on the new car, with <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=1E8F347D-1143-FDC9-354B10598809C122.html" target="_blank">Fernandez Racing continuing in LMP2</a> with the ARX-01 in LMP2.
        <br>Pescarolo went into its 3rd season with an updated 01 Evo, but <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5988B39B-1143-FDC9-35AF4FC90161919D.html" target="_blank">financial strain saw the company sold</a>. The team continued operating as Pescarolo Sport in LMS with 1 full season entry and 1 only for the first half, and for Le Mans they brought a customer Peugeot alongside one of their own chassis. The team also competed in the AsLMS, but due to the new ownership the team was entered as SORA Racing.
        <br>Having taken over Courage in 2007, Oreca developed a new car for 2009 in the form of the 01. The team staterd the season with the old Courages, before debuting the new car at Spa and competing at Le Mans and the rest of the LMS.
        <br>Economic concerns and regulation changes saw Creation start winding down operations. The team chose to only bring a single car to Le Mans, while focusing on supporting its customers.
        <br>Epsilon Euskadi also withdrew from sportscars in 2009, with the team focusing on its single seater program and planning an entry to F1.
        <br>Lavaggi was also forced to update the car for 2009, but the economic difficulties meant the updates couldn't be tested in the wind tunnel, meaning the car became very difficult to drive. The team aimed to continue competing in the LMS, but economic difficulties meant the team shut down by the end of the season.
        <br>A newcomer to the top class for <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=16B23207-1143-FDC9-3557464BD2588D38.html" target="_blank">2009 was Aston Martin</a>, debuting the AMR1-2 and taking on a full LMS season.
        <br>Meanwhile in the GT categories, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B0A6B051-1143-FDC9-35A94573F8F1C0D1.html" target="_blank">BMW returned with a factory team</a> in the GT2 class for the first time since 2001, partnering with team RLL. After racing alone in GT1 for several years Corvette Racing took the desicion to <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=48419703-1143-FDC9-35AB74254674246B.html" target="_blank">modify their car to GT2-spec</a>. They started in GT1 for the first few races whilst the new car was developed, but moved to GT2 for the 2nd half of the season.
        <br>ALMS continued to target stabilisation, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=C3B07C3E-1143-FDC9-3546F6B0D7D2B272.html" target="_blank">keeping all the events from 2008</a>, the only change being Road America going back to the standard 2h 45min format. With the number of entries reduced following Audi's withdrawal as a full time entrant IMSA allowed <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=4A00BCD0-1143-FDC9-35974FC1A9F35124.html" target="_blank">teams from the Porsche cup challenge</a> to race at selected events in their own class.
        <br>The LMS made a few changes for <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=E72C2A2A-1143-FDC9-359FD103A4D59605.html" target="_blank">their 2009 calendar</a>, with Monza being replaced by a night event at the new Algarve circuit in Portugal.
        <br>After the planned AsLMS race in Shanghai was cancelled in 2008, plans for a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B65743C4-1143-FDC9-3504CDAE15BD9E5E.html" target="_blank">series launch in 2009</a> were still on, with 2 events in Okayama in Japan and Shanghai in China, and a revised format with 2 500km races per event.

                <br><div class="notes">
                    #66 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #2 Audi and #07 Peugeot, as #08 Peugeot was forced to start from the back after a hydraulic failure in the warm-up.
                    #2 Audi immediately took the lead at the start with #07 Peugeot also taking 2nd from #66 on the first lap with #66 shuffled back to 4th.
                    As the leaders made their first stop #07 Peugeot took the lead after taking fuel only, however #2 Audi fought back to take the lead on fresher tyres early in the 2nd hour with #07 dropping back throughout the stint and eventually losing 2nd to #1.
                    #9 Acura spun off later in the 2nd hour, bringing out the safety car. #07 Peugeot made its 2nd stop just before the safety car came out, cycling to the lead when the rest of the leaders made their stop when the pits opened, with #08 Peugeot also moving into 3rd ahead of #1 Audi.
                    #1 Audi then tangled in traffic and spun, while #08 Peugeot caught and passed #2 Audi for 2nd into the 3rd hour. As the leaders made their 3rd stop Peugeot again took fuel only and extended the gap to the Audis.
                    Another safety car later in the 3rd hour saw the leaders stop again, with the Audis taking time to remove debris from the radiators and replace the engine covers.
                    Drama in the 4th hour as #07 Peugeot spun off, handing the lead to #08 and dropping to 4th behind both Audis. More pit cycles saw #07 back in 2nd until #2 Audi caught and passed it into the 5th hour, as moments later #08 spun and only just held on to the lead. Later in the 5th hour #07 Peugeot pitted with electrical issues caused by a malfunctioning air condition, dropping several laps down.
                    #2 Audi was gradually catching the leading #08, and as they cycled through the pits 5h in the Audi took the lead. However the Peugeot stayed within reach, and at the next stop an hour later it took fuel only and emerged back in the lead.
                    Shortly after #66 Acura pitted with smoke from the car, but after a quick check rejoined. Sister #9 spun out in the 7th hour, and struggling to start the car meant the safety car was deployed. The leaders pitted with #08 maintaining the lead, as the Acura pitted for repairs.
                    As the leaders pitted in the 8th hour #1 Audi took fuel only, trying a double stint for the first time. That allowed it to briefly take 2nd behind #08 Peugeot.
                    Problems struck #66 Acura at the 8h mark, going to the garage and retiring with suspension issues and a fuel leak. Into the 9th hour and #9 also hit problems, struggling with the hydraulic power steering.
                    At the same time #2 Audi was pressuring #08 Peugeot, and the Audi briefly took the lead before pitting. The Peugeot stopped a lap later, with the Audi maintaining the lead.
                    Approaching 9h #08 Peugeot pitted out of sequence with a slow puncture. When #2 Audi pitted from the lead early in the 10th hour the Peugeot cycled to the lead until it made its next scheduled stop.
                    #9 Acura continued to struggle with the power steering, and in the 11th hour the car went to the garage and retired with gearbox failure.
                    #07 Peugeot stopped on track and retired with gearbox failure in the final hour, as #2 Audi controlled the closing stages to take the win despite a late splash with #08 Peugeot finishing 2nd ahead of #1.

                    #66 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #9 and #15, and controlled the opening stages as #9 lost time with a brief spin that dropped it behind #15.
                    #66 made its first stop 50 min in, but a safety car just afterwards saw #9 and #15 make their first stop and rejoin ahead with #15 resuming the lead.
                    #66 started suffering technical problems and pitted as #9 took the lead after pressuring #15.
                    #66 Acura continued to suffer electrical issues, with the team unable to diagnose it, and eventually stopped on track and retired. Meanwhile #9 Acura cruised home to take the win, with #15 Acura finishing 2nd.

                    #23 Strakka qualified on pole ahead of the two Astons, however #007 went from 3rd to the lead immediately, followed by #13 Lola and #009.
                    An early safety car saw the leaders make their first stop, but chaos in the pit lane saw #16 Pescarolo take the lead ahead of #009 and #13.
                    Another safety car in the 2nd hour saw the leaders make their 2nd stop, except #13 which cycled to the lead ahead of #007. As the race restarted #16 Pescarolo put pressure on #009 and took 3rd.
                    #13 eventually made its 2nd stop, handing the lead to #007 Aston. As the leaders made their 3rd stop #16 Pescarolo took the lead with #007 Aston taking full service. #007 pressured #16 throughout the stint, but as they were stuck in traffic it allowed #11 Oreca to catch them, and into the 4th hour it took 2nd from the Aston. However soon after it pitted with gearbox issues.
                    #16 maintained the lead through the next pit cycle, and a spin from #007 towards the end of the 4th hour gave the Pescarolo a comfortable lead.
                    #16 made its final stop early in the final hour and maintained the lead, but shortly after #009 Aston spun and retired with gearbox failure, bringing out the safety car.
                    As the race restarted #007 closed down the leading Pescarolo, and as #16 got baulked in traffic the Aston took the lead and cruised home to take the win, with #16 Pescarolo coming home 2nd.

                    #9 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #66 and #15, but #66 took the lead at the start 2nd time around after the first start was waved off as the cars were not lined up properly.
                    #9 fought back to re-take the lead later in the first stint, as #9 and #15 Acuras pitted together after 1 hour, however #9 was penalized 20s for a pit stop infringement that later turned out to be incorrect.
                    #66 Acura stopped from the lead a few laps later and rejoined in the lead, controlling the closing stages to take the win.
                    After the debacle in the pits #9 Acura fought back to take 2nd from #15 as they manouvered through #25 and #90 tangling, with the race ending under safety car after a fire for #25.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row ahead of #009 Aston, as sister #007 started from the pit lane after problems in qualifying.
                    #7 Peugeot controlled the start as several cars stranded on the formation lap and contact between #009 Aston and #16 Pescarolo brought out the safety car, with #009 limping back with a puncture and #16 spinning.
                    Another safety car in the opening hour saw #17 Pescarolo tangle on the restart, pitting with suspension issues.
                    The early safety cars allowed #009 Aston to recover, and by the end of the first hour the car was back in 3rd as the leaders made their first stop. #7 maintained the lead, but #16 Pescarolo was putting heavy pressure on until it made its first stop a few laps later.
                    The Peugeots maintained the lead through the 2nd pit cycle, but early in the 3rd hour #9 pitted and went into the garage with suspension issues and dropped several laps down.
                    Later in the same hour #17 Pescarolo suffered a big accident, spreading debris all over the track and bringing out the safety car. Both Astons were forced to pit with non-functioning headlights, allowing #11 Oreca into 2nd ahead of #16 Pescarolo, with #7 Peugeot still leading.
                    As the race entered the 5th hour #16 Pescarolo was catching #11, which first collided with the #15 Kolles Audi, and then tangled in traffic, allowing the Pescarolo to take 2nd.
                    Meanwhile #7 Peugeot controlled the closing stages to take the win ahead of #16 Pescarolo, ahead of #007 Aston which took 3rd after a late scrap with #11.

                    #8 Peugeot qualified on pole ahead of #1 Audi, with #7 and #17 Pescarolo Peugeot on the 2nd row.
                    #8 controlled the start as #7 and #9 moved up to lie 2nd and 3rd in the opening laps, demoting #1 Audi to 4th. #3 Audi went off just a few minutes into the race, getting stuck in the gravel and returning to the pits with front end damage.
                    As the leaders made their first stop there was drama in the pits as #7 Peugeot and #17 collided, #17 suffering nose damage and spent time in the garage, while #7 suffered a puncture which caused extensive damage limping back to the pits, dropping 7 laps down.
                    The resulting safety car saw the Audis make their first stop as #009 Aston went into the garage with a broken alternator belt. The safety car allowed #9 Peugeot to make an extra stop to top up the fuel, with #8 Peugeot leading from #1 Audi and #007 Aston.
                    As the race restarted #2 Audi took 3rd from the Aston, and as the leaders made their 2nd stop #2 Audi took 2nd as #1 dropped behind #9 to 4th after a nose change.
                    #9 Peugeot then pressured #2 Audi and moved into 2nd as the race reached 2 hours, with #1 Audi moving into 3rd at the 3rd pit cycle.
                    As the race reached 4 hours #009 Aston was back in the garage with electrical issues as the Audis kept swapping positions through the pit cycles, with #2 taking a new nose to try to find more pace.
                    Into the 5th hour and #009 hit problems again, colliding with #26 which crashed out. The accident saw another safety car period, and the driver in the Aston was excluded from the rest of the race.
                    As the race restarted #3 Audi returned to the garage with engine issues.
                    Drama late in the 6th hour as #8 Peugeot pitted from the lead and went into the garage with gearbox issues, #9 took over the lead followed by #1 and #2 Audis as #8 rejoined 4th.
                    The drama continued in the 7th hour as #2 Audi crashed out after suffering a suspension failure. That left #1 in 3rd ahead of the recovering #8 Peugeot which was in a fight with #17 and #008 Aston.
                    #008 Aston pitted in the 8th hour and went into the garage with a broken wheel and suspension damage after contact. Towards the end of the hour #1 Audi pitted and went into the garage briefly to clear the radiators, dropping behind #8 Peugeot to 3rd. However as the race entered its 9th hour #8 was involved in an incident and required a new nose at its next stop, dropping back behind the Audi.
                    #1 Audi had another visit to the garage as the race passed the half way point, clearing out the brake ducts before rejoining behind #8 Peugeot. Shortly after #7 has another visit to the garage with suspension issues.
                    Drama as the race reached 13 hours as #17 Pescarolo Peugeot suffered a big accident, the car destroyed after crashing out from 4th. #1 Audi took the opportunity to visit the garage again under the resulting safety car to clear the radiators. The accident for #17 left #007 Aston in 4th overall.
                    As dawn broke and the race went into the 17th hour #008 Aston suffered more issues, going into the garage with gearbox issues and dropping out of the top 10. The car briefly rejoined in the 18th hour but a suspension failure sent the car back to the garage. #16 Pescarolo had a steady race until a visit to the garage around the same time.
                    Into the 19th hour and #1 had another trip to the garage to clear radiators before rejoining, still 3rd but dropping further behind the Peugeots ahead. Later in the same hour #009 Aston crashed out and retired to end a miserable, trouble-filled race. After the safety car period #3 Audi went off and got stuck in the gravel, before limping back to the garage.
                    Electrical issues struck #1 Audi in the 21st hour along with suspension issues and sent it back to the garage, this time a longer stop allowing #007 Aston to close the gap.
                    #9 Peugeot cruised home to take the win with sister #8 following it home ahead of #1 Audi after a difficult race.

                    #66 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #9, but #9 jumped the start and it was abandoned.
                    2nd time around #66 controlled the start and led the early stages.
                    #15 Acura hit problems and pitted 40 min in with gearbox issues, dropping down the order. Shortly afterwards #66 suffered damage after contact, with #9 closing the gap.
                    The two Dysons took over 3rd and 4th after the problems for #15, but they both suffered issues of their own at the first stop.
                    A safety car around the same time saw the leaders make their first stop at the 1h mark with #66 maintaining the lead.
                    The Dysons maintained 3rd and 4th with #15 Acura suffering more problems in the 2nd stint, a puncture forcing another stop.
                    #66 Acura made its 2nd stop 35 min from the end. #9 made its stop a few laps later and took only 2 tyres, emerging in the lead.
                    Drama in the closing stages as #9 pitted from the lead with a puncture, leaving #66 Acura in the lead and it cruised home to take the win.

                    #11 Oreca qualified on pole ahead of #007 Aston and #10 Oreca, with #11 controlling the start until the Aston took the lead in in the opening hour.
                    #11 then went into the garage with a fuel leak, leaving sister #10 in 2nd followed by #23 Strakka.
                    #16 Pescarolo was moving up the order, taking 2nd from both #10 and #23 before the leaders made their first stop.
                    #007 Aston maintained the lead through the first stop, but into the 2nd hour the Aston spun off in traffic, handing the lead to #16 Pescarolo followed by #23 and #10.
                    #23 then pitted and went into the garage with a misfire, dropping out of the lead fight as the rest made their 2nd stop with #16 maintaining the lead ahead of #10 and the recovering #007.
                    Approaching 3h #007 Aston moved into 2nd ahead of #10, and drama as #16 Pescarolo pitted out of sequence to replace the nose after collecting damage.
                    The stop dropped #16 to 2nd with #007 taking the lead, but as the Aston made its next stop #16 cycled back to the lead.
                    The Pescarolo pitted at the 5h mark and handed the lead to #007, but as the Aston made its final stop into the 6th hour #16 was left with a substantial lead.

                    Aston Martin locked out the front row with #007 taking pole ahead of #009, and they controlled the opening stages until the first round of pit stops.
                    The Astons took fuel only and maintained the lead ahead of the #13 Speedy Sebah and #16 Pescarolo.
                    Into the 2nd hour and drama for #16 Pescarolo, going into the garage and retiring with gearbox failure.
                    #009 struggled on worn tyres in the 2nd stint, with #13 gaining before the Astons made their 2nd stop. #13 hit problems in the 3rd stint, leaving #14 Kolles Audi 3rd by the time the leaders made their 3rd stop.
                    #007 hit problems in the 4th hour, a costly spin in traffic and then off the pace saw #009 take the lead, with #008 moving into 3rd after #14 stopped out of sequence.
                    At the next stop approaching 4h #007 took fuel only, rejoining in the lead before dropping back behind #009 and making another stop shortly after.
                    That left #009 with a comfortable lead until its penultimate stop in the 5th hour, handing the lead back to #007.
                    #007 pitted from the lead for its final stop at the start of the 6th hour, with #009 following it a few laps later. #007 controlled the closing stages to take the win as Aston Martin swept the podium with #009 and #008 finishing 2nd and 3rd.

                    #9 Acura qualified on pole, but #66 took the lead at the start with #37 Intersport following it through and initially challenging for the lead before dislodging the nose and pitting for repairs.
                    #66 made an early first stop with gearbox issues, radio problems also causing confusion with the driver change as the required drive time was not yet completed. The car then went off briefly exiting the pits, costing it more time.
                    #9 struggled in the first stint, being overtaken by #20 Dyson, which then ended up in the lead once #66 made its unscheduled first stop.
                    #9 took the lead once #20 made its first stop, and a safety car close to the end of the first hour saw #9 make its first stop. It maintained the lead as #66 also made its 2nd stop with the gearbox oil leak continuing, as well as another stop to top up with fuel before the restart.
                    In the 2nd stop #66 made another stop to continue topping up with gearbox oil, with #9 making its 2nd stop in the final hour and cruised home to take the win. #66 limped home to take 2nd after making more stops for oil refills in the final stages.

                    A heroic first stint from #16 Pescarolo saw it go from the back of the grid to the lead by the time the leaders made their first stop.
                    #16 took fuel only and maintained the lead ahead of #10 and #007. #16 then had a scrappy stint, tangling and spinning in traffic in the 2nd hour.
                    The leaders maintained position though the 2nd stop, but drama early in the 3rd hour as #16 Pescarolo went into the garage with gearbox issues and handed the lead to #10.
                    The Pescarolo rejoined after 30 min in the garage, just as #008 Aston went in with alternator issues. As the leaders cycled through the pits around the 4h mark #13 moved past #007, as #009 Aston suffered a puncture and was forced to pit.
                    As the leaders made their final stop #13 emerged in the lead after taking fuel only, but #10 was catching rapidly as the race entered the 6th hour.
                    Drama in the closing stages with #13 forced to pit with damage, handing the lead to #10 which went on to take the win. #13 finished 2nd ahead of the pair of #007 and #009 Astons.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row ahead of the 2 Audis, as #9 Acura started from the pit lane after a huge accident in practice that required a new chassis.
                    Heavy rain on race day and #2 Audi took the lead at the start, ahead of #07 Peugeot and #1, with the second Audi taking 2nd in the early stages.
                    The Peugeots struggled in the first stint as the track gradually dried, #08 dropping to 5th before making its first stop 40 min in for a new set of wets, and #07 lost 3rd to #66 Acura before making its first stop just after the hour mark and took slicks.
                    #2 Audi and #66 Acura pitted shortly after for slicks, with #1 staying out a few more laps and rejoined in 4th after making its switch to slicks.
                    #2 Audi resumed the lead as #08 Peugeot had to make another stop for slicks as the track continued to dry.
                    #66 Acura then tangled with #37 Intersport, breaking the suspension and forcing it into the garage and handing 3rd to #1 Audi behind the leading #2 and #07 Peugeot.
                    A safety car later in the 2nd hour saw the leaders make their 2nd stop, with #2 Audi maintaining the lead despite being delayed after sliding in the wet pit lane. As the race restarted #08 Peugeot took 3rd from #1, both now a lap down from the leader.
                    #66 Acura then went off as the race entered its 3rd hour, hitting the wall and triggering another safety car and more repairs in the garage.
                    As the race restarted #08 Peugeot started fighting back, unlapping itself from the leading #2 Audi until the leaders made their 3rd stop, with #2 maintaining the lead after taking fuel only, which put #08 again a lap down.
                    As the race entered its 4th hour #08 again unlapped itself from #2 Audi as #07 also started pressuring the leader. Rain returned in the 4th hour as another safety car saw the leaders cycle through the pits, with #08 cycling around to the lead lap. Problems continued for #66 Acura, electrical issues saw the car spend more time in the garage.
                    As the race restarted #08 Peugeot took 2nd from #07, and another safety car later in the 4th hour saw drama as #2 Audi spun on the damp track, handing the lead to #08 and dropping to 3rd. #2 then made another stop to top up with fuel and take a new set of tyres.
                    Into the 5th hour and the heavens opened just as the 2 Audis pitted for wets, the Peugeots following a lap later on a quickly soaking track. That allowed #2 Audi to split the Peugeots, but then spun off as the conditions became undriveable with #1 and several other cars also aquaplaning off.
                    The safety car came out due to the track conditions, but with the torrential rain continuing the red flag came out near the end of the 5th hour.
                    After spending almost 4 hours under red flag, darkness fell with no sign of improving conditions, and the race was forced to be abandoned with #08 Peugeot taking the win ahead of sistr #07 and #2 Audi.

                    #66 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #9, and they controlled the lead as #37 challenged #9 and took 2nd on the restart after an early safety car, however #9 soon fought back to retake 2nd.
                    #66 Made its first stop just as the safety car came out late in the first hour and cycled back to the lead as #9 made its first stop when the pit lane opened.
                    #9 was then caught in a pile-up as the race restarted and had to pit for repairs under the resulting safety car, handing 2nd to #15. #9 then had to make another unscheduled stop later in the 2nd hour with a faulty sensor.
                    #66 made its 2nd stop under another safety car at the end of the 2nd hour, maintaining the lead ahead of #16 Dyson and #15, with #9 recovering to 4th.
                    #16 then tangled in traffic in the 3rd hour, handing 2nd to #15 with #9 moving up to 3rd.
                    #66 made its 3rd stop at the end of the 3rd hour and took fuel only, with #15 stopping shortly after, taking fuel and new tyres.
                    #15 rapidly caught #66 and challenged for the lead, with the cars trading places in the closing stages, but #66 absorbed the pressure to take the win, with #9 rescuing 3rd.

                    #87 Drayson qualified on pole and controlled the start as #10 Oreca and #007 Aston shuffled #17 Pescarolo from 2nd to 4th.
                    The top 4 battled for position throughout the opening stages, until #87 had to make an early first stop with faulty headlights, dropping 3 laps down.
                    That left #10 in the lead with #007 and #17 still on its tail, until they made their first stop around the hour mark.
                    #007 Aston took the lead after jumping #10, with #17 still 3rd, both putting intense pressure on the Aston throughout the 2nd stint.
                    The leading trio made their 2nd stop approaching the 2h mark, with #007 staying in front as #17 jumped #10 for 3rd.

        <h2>2010 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After a disappointing 2009 season Audi launched 2010 with a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=62B36186-1143-FDC9-35AD3C3C71F6D285.html" target="_blank">heavily revised R15 TDI Plus</a>, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=76783063-B2F7-C457-FD77B99C1C21BA3D.html" target="_blank">debuting the car at the LMS Opener</a> at Castellet before bringing it to Spa before Le Mans.
        <br>Peugeot ran a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=2BDC458E-FDBC-88D7-4432D1EA399FD3CE.html" target="_blank">similar program to 2009</a> with more minor updated to the 908 HDi FAP, competing at Sebring and Spa in preparation for Le Mans.
        <br>After winning the Le Mans Series in 2009 Aston Martin went into their 2nd season <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=89B566DB-96AD-E70E-9E57397B2F02428D.html" target="_blank">targeting a variety of events</a>, bringing a car to Sebring, Le Castellet and Long Beach before Le Mans, and then competing at selected races afterwards.
        <br>Oreca continued into 2010 racing selected events with the 01, but their main focus was their customer Peugeot.
        <br>Acura withdrew from the ALMS for 2010, but HPD continued the program and continued their <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=2B59118D-C9CA-4660-4BDEA056A551AFA7.html" target="_blank">partnership with Highcroft</a> as well as forming a new partnership with Strakka Racing in Europe. The ARX-02 was abandoned with the team racing a single updated ARX-01c in the ALMS, and for the first time <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=95DF5377-1143-FDC9-35B544C06C0FE1C6.html" target="_blank">bringing the car to Le Mans</a>. Fernandez Racing and de Ferran Motorsport both closed their doors following the 2009 season.
        <br>After selling the team in 2009, the economic difficulties continued for Pescarolo, and going into 2010 the team was shut down and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=D2DFEEF3-1143-FDC9-35FAA09D2BD77520.html" target="_blank">the team went into administration</a> later in the year.
        <br>ALMS revealed a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=23C6A95B-1143-FDC9-3556701BD8D11B8F.html" target="_blank">new class structure for 2010</a>, with LMP1 and LMP2 cars compined into a single class for all rounds except Sebring and Petit Le Mans. A new class was added in the form of Prototype Challenge, using the new Oreca FLM chassis based on the Courage LC75. After competing at 5 rounds in 2009 the Challenge class became GTC and joined the series full-time in 2010, opening up to include other versions of the Porsche cup-car.
        <br>LMS also revised its class structure, it too <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=EEB13DA1-1143-FDC9-3541DF8B5B03128A.html" target="_blank">adding a fifth class for the Oreca FLM</a> which came from a project between Oreca and the ACO.
        <br>ALMS revealed a slightly <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=F29D54E1-1143-FDC9-350E024472BDD5B3.html" target="_blank">revised calendar for 2010</a>, with St. Petersburg dropping off the calendar, and Laguna Seca moving to May and being extended to 6 Hours.
        <br>The LMS also revealed a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=61AFEEC4-1143-FDC9-352B9D2062FE4FB8.html" target="_blank">slightly modified calendar</a>, with Catalunya and Nurburgring being replaced by Paul Ricard and Hungaroring, and the former being 8 Hours instead of the usual 1000km/6 hours.
        <br>Also announced in 2010 was the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=6FD936D3-1143-FDC9-358B501ADD59013D.html" target="_blank">Intercontinental Le Mans Cup</a>, a new championship taking in 3 races across the 3 Le Mans Series', starting at the LMS race at Silverstone before moving to the Petit Le Mans and ending at the sole AsLMS race at Zhuhai. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=2C70681B-1143-FDC9-355442E2DA7736B5.html" target="_blank">Peugeot joined</a>, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=A45C7DCA-1143-FDC9-35D1C29C8F1CCD63.html" target="_blank">as did Audi</a>, both with 2 cars each.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row ahead of #007 Aston, but a good start saw #8 Drayson take 3rd from #007, and after pressuring #08 in traffic #8 took 2nd.
                    The leaders made their first stop at the end of the first hour, with #08 taking fuel only and rejoining in the lead, with #8 dropping to 3rd after its stop before taking 2nd from #07 which struggled on cold tyres.
                    A safety car shortly after saw #007 Aston make an additional stop for a splash, as #8 made its 2nd stop half way through the 2nd hour.
                    The leading Peugeots made their 2nd stop near the end of the 2nd hour with #08 maintaining the lead as #8 pressured from behind.
                    #8 then suffered alternator issues in the 3rd hour, a lengthy visit in the pits costing it time and handed 3rd to #007.
                    #08 Peugeot controlled the lead for the next few hours, with #07 trying to keep up, but a spin in the 5th hour cost it time.
                    A safety car in the 7th hour saw the leaders stop together, but #08 then pitted out of sequence at the end of the hour and handed the lead to #07.
                    Another safety car in the 8th hour saw the leaders again stop together, with #08 rejoining back in the lead. However as they pitted early in the 9th hour it was #07 emerging in the lead.
                    #07 then controlled the remaining hours, made its last stop 45 min from the end and cruised home to take the win, with sister #08 making its last stop 5 min later on course to finish 2nd. #007 Aston finished a lonely 3rd, 3 laps down.

                    #4 Oreca Peugeot qualified on pole ahead of #7 Audi and #009 Aston, however with #4 and #7 scrapping at the start #009 went through them both to take the lead. However the Audi quickly fought back to take the lead, with #4 following it into 2nd.
                    #009 then suffered a puncture later in the opening stint, costing it time and forcing it off sequence with the others.
                    The leaders made their first stop at the end of the opening hour, but #4 suffered a proplem with the pneumatic jacks and was forced into the garage and dropped 8 laps. That left #7 Audi in the lead ahead of #009 Aston and #13 Rebellion.
                    #7 controlled the race from the front, and as the race entered the final hour #009 made its final stop from 2nd, but a long stop cost it time and saw #13 close the gap. Rain started falling in the final 10 min, and #7 Audi stopped for wets before cruising home to take the win ahead of #009 Aston and #13 Rebellion.
                    #4 Oreca Peugeot recovered from its early drama to finish 4th.

                    After a series of early safety cars #37 made a blinding restart to take the lead, and as #007 and #1 scrapped for 2nd they collided, sending #007 into the wall and damaging the rear, and #1 was handed a stop/go for the incident.
                    A safety car near the hour mark saw the leaders make their first stop, #1 emerging in the lead ahead of #6 Cytosport and #007. #007 took 2nd at the restart and started catching #1 which suffered from a gearbox issue, and with just 10 min left the Aston took the lead.
                    However #1 fought back and barged its way back into the lead on the final lap as #007 struggled with the brakes to take the win.

                    #3 Peugeot qualified on pole ahead of #9 Audi, with #2 and #4 Oreca Peugeot filling the 2nd row.
                    Drama before the start as #8 Audi went off on the formation lap in damp conditions, bringing the car back to the pits for repairs. #4 also spun but managed to rejoin and took the start as normal.
                    At the start #3 Peugeot spun, handing the lead to #2 ahead of #4 as #7 and #9 Audis were shuffled back. However #1 then took 2nd ahead of #7 as #4 dropped back by the time an early safety car came out.
                    As the race restarted #4 collided with #13 Rebellion, sending #4 off and into retirement. #13 then continued moving up the order, taking 3rd from #7.
                    Meanwhile #3 was fighting back, taking 5th from #12 Rebellion before #7 Audi took 3rd from #13 with #3 following through. #3 then put pressure on the Audi and took 3rd.
                    As the track was drying #3 started closing the gap with #2 still leading ahead of #1.
                    Another safety car towards the end of the opening hour saw #7 make its first stop, with the rest of the leaders staying out.
                    #7 rejoined 5th but quickly took 4th from #9 as the race restarted, and cycled to the lead as the rest of the leaders made their first stop.
                    Drama as a power outage struck the whole circuit towards the end of the 2nd hour, with the backup power system kicking in but timing and scoring went blank and the TV broadcast ceased.
                    As the leaders made their 2nd stop at the end of the 2nd hour #7 stayed ahead of #3 Peugeot as #2 tangled in traffic and went off, limping back to the pits with substantial damage. 
                    #1 cycled to the lead having not stopped before the race was red flagged around the 2h mark as the backup power was running out and race control was set to lose CCTV and the ability to communicate with the marshals.
                    As the race restarted later in the 3rd hour #1 pitted and handed the lead to #7 Audi, which now faced intense pressure from #3 Peugeot. The pair traded places into the 4th hour, but the Audi stayed ahead.
                    The leaders made their 3rd stop with #3 taking fuel only and rejoining in the lead, with #7 struggling throughout the stint.
                    The Audi continued to struggle after another cycle through the pits, dropping back towards #1 and eventually losing 2nd as #3 continued to lead.
                    Another safety car as the final hour started, #1 made its final stop followed by #2, with #3 and #7 staying out.
                    Rain started falling in the final hour, and #3 made its final stop 30 min from the end and took inters as #7 and #1 struggled on slicks with #1 going off.
                    #7 stopped for inters and started catching #3 which then went grass-trekking, but as the track started drying again #3 got back to speed and cruised home to the win, with #7 starting to struggle and lost 2nd to #2 in the final minutes.

                    #16 Dyson qualified on pole ahead of #1 Acura and #6 Cytosport, but #1 was forced to start from the back after issues in practice.
                    A blinding start saw #37 Intersport go from 3rd to the lead at the start, with #1 moving through the field to take 4th in the opening stages.
                    After an early safety car #16, #6 and #1 all scrapped for 2nd, with #6 taking 2nd from #16, and #1 demoting the Dyson to 4th.
                    Drama as #37 suffered a turbo failure towards the end of the first hour, and pitted to retire.
                    That left #6 in the lead, as #16 made its first stop early in the 2nd hour, but was handed a stop/go for speeding in the pit lane. #1 made its first stop a few laps later, as #6 stretched its fuel to go longer.
                    #6 made its first stop as the safety car came out and handed the lead to #1, with #16 taking the opportunity to make its 2nd stop under the safety car.
                    Into the 3rd hour and #6 took the lead before another safety car, #1 pitted and #6 second guessed itself, losing the lead as it followed #1 in. #16 also stopped and took fuel only to cycle to the lead.
                    #6 then spun on the restart before pitting again, before stopping on track with a gearbox issue.
                    That triggered another safety car, and as the race restarted around the half way point #16 spun and collided, sustaining damage and triggering another safety car as #1 took the lead.
                    As the race entered the 5th hour #1 stopped, but #16 stayed out and rejoined the lead lap, and another safety car allowed the Dyson to catch up. #16 then caught #1 and took the lead late in the 5th hour.
                    The Dyson made its final stop early in the final hour, with #1 stopping a few laps later and cycled to the lead after taking fuel only.
                    Drama in the final stages as #16 stopped on track with an engine issue, bringing out another safety car and allowed #1 to cruise home to take the win.

                    Peugeot locked out the top 4 in qualifying with the 3 factory cars followed by the Oreca car, with the 3 Audis following.
                    #3 Peugeot controlled the start as #7 Audi moved into 5th and tried to pressure #4 Oreca Peugeot for 4th as #2 Peugeot took 2nd from #1.
                    An early safety car saw the Peugeots and Audis split with the Audis ending up half a lap behind. #4 made its first stop for a splash before the restart.
                    The leaders made their first stop around the hour mark, with #2 Peugeot taking the lead ahead of #3 and #1.
                    The Peugeots traded places for the lead but #2 still lead by the time the leaders made their 2nd stop.
                    As the leaders cycled through the pits in the 3rd hour #3 Peugeot suffered a suspension failure and retired after returning to the garage.
                    #2 continued to hold the lead with #1 now 2nd ahead of #4.
                    The leaders cycled through the pits around the 4h mark, with #1 taking the lead from #2. Into the 5th hour and drama for #7 Audi as it went off trying to avoid another car limping back with a puncture. The car was towed out and limped back to the garage for repairs, leaving #9 in 4th.
                    A long stop in the 6th hour for #9 to replace a mirror following an incident in the pits earlier but maintained 4th ahead of #8.
                    Safety car at the 6h mark saw #1 and #2 split with #1 ending up with a 2 min lead. Meanwhile #8 took 4th from #9 before pitting at the end of the 7th hour.
                    Drama in the 8th hour as #1 pitted and went into the garage with alternator failure, dropping to 7th as #2 took over the lead ahead of #4 and #8.
                    #9 Audi moved back to 3rd as they cycled through the pits around the end of the 9th hour.
                    #1 Peugeot was fighting to recover after the earlier problem, but it went off in the 11th hour after being caught out in traffic and had to be rescued out.
                    Just before the 12 hour mark #4 pitted and went into the garage with a driveshaft failure, leaving #9 2nd ahead of #8 with #2 Peugeot still leading comfortably.
                    Shortly after and into the 13th hour #8 suffered a puncture on the out lap, having to pit again but maintained 3rd.
                    Drama just after the 16 hour mark as the leading #2 Peugeot retired with engine failure, #9 Audi took over the lead ahead of #8 and the recovering #1 Peugeot.
                    Later in the same hour #007 Aston went into the garage from 6th overall with gearbox issues.
                    #1 started pushing hard and in the process tangled in traffic, sending the GT2 leader off. 
                    Into the 21st hour and #8 went off and hit the wall, limping back to the pits for a new nose before rejoining, #1 Peugeot now right behind and took 2nd at the end of the hour before pitting.
                    The drama continued as late in the 22nd hour #1 Peugeot suffered an engine failure and retired from 2nd. Audi now 1-2-3 with #9 leading from #8 and #7 but the remaining #4 still catching, however it too suffered an engine failure with just over an hour to go.
                    Aston Martin looked to pick up the pieces from the disintegrating Peugeots, but early in the final hour #009 retired with an engine failure and #007 were slowed with a puncture. That left Audi to dominate the podium with #9 taking the win ahead of #8 and #7.

                    Safety car as the race reached the hour mark allowed the leaders to make their first stop. #1 cycled to the lead ahead of #37 and #8.
                    As the race restarted #37 again went straight to the lead until traffic saw #1 move back ahead, with the Intersport then dropping behind #8 as well after burning through the tyres.
                    #8 then caught #1 and took the lead in traffic, before the leaders made their final stop into the final 45 minutes. #1 Acura cycled to the lead with a shorter stop after saving fuel in the middle stint.
                    #16 Dyson retired from 3rd in the closing stages with engine issues, as #1 Highcroft Acura cruised home to take the win.

                    #4 Oreca Peugeot qualified on pole ahead of #12 Rebellion, #008 Signatech Aston and #13 Rebellion, however the Rebellions started from the back after issues in qualifying.
                    #4 controlled the start ahead of #008, with the two Rebellions fighting through the field throughout the first stint.
                    The leaders made their first stop approaching the end of the opening hour, with #4 maintaining the lead ahead of #008 and #12. However #008 was handed a 30s stop/go for speeding in the pits before delays starting the car meant it rejoined 5th.
                    #12 took over 2nd, and after the leaders made their 2nd stop during the 2nd hour #008 soon re-took 3rd from #42 Strakka, with #13 then taking 4th.
                    #13 then put pressure on #008 and took 3rd, but as the leaders pitted in the 3rd hour it spun after tangling in traffic before spinning again trying to recover. The car went into the garage at the next stop for repairs.
                    #4 Peugeot controlled the lead going into the final hour and made a late stop for a splash late in the race on the way to the win ahead of #12 Rebellion and #008 Aston despite a spin in the final hour.

                    #1 Acura qualified on pole ahead of #6 Cytosport Porsche and #16 Dyson in a wet qualifying.
                    As the race started #1 was swamped with #16 taking the lead ahead of #8 Drayson and #37 Intersport.
                    #16 Dyson slowed and pitted with engine issues early in the race, handing the lead to #8 and retiring in the garage.
                    #37 then tangled in traffic and had to pit with damaged suspension as the safety car came out.
                    As the race restarted #8 stopped on track with electrical issues, however the car got going again as another safety car came out and #1 took over the lead ahead of #6.
                    After the restart #6 tangled in traffic but continued as #8 suffered more electrical issues and continued dropping down the order.
                    Another safety car late in the opening hour saw #6 make its first stop, with the leading #1 yet to stop.
                    Over the 2nd stint #6 started catching #1 and took the lead as #1 made its only stop of the race.
                    #6 made its 2nd stop shortly after and maintained the lead as the race approached 2 hours.
                    #1 was trying to catch up, and after initially struggling in heavy traffic started catching rapidly as they battled through a small rainshower.
                    As #1 caught #6 for the lead they made contact navigating traffic, with #1 suffering a puncture and #6 was handed a stop/go for the incident.
                    However with #1 limping around #6 was able to serve the penalty and rejoin ahead to take the win as #1 rescued 2nd.

                    Audi locked out the front row ahead of the two Peugeots, as #007 Aston started from the back after issues in qualifying.
                    #7 controlled the start as #1 took 2nd from #8 and started pressuring the leader, and after a big battle and track limit warnings the Peugeot took the lead.
                    At the same time #4 Oreca Peugeot took 3rd from #8, but drama as #1 stopped on track and retired with a driveshaft failure.
                    That left #4 in 2nd ahead of #8, with the leaders making their first stop late in the opening hour.
                    #007 tangled in traffic and spun, and after making its first stop the clutch burnt out and the car had to go into the garage.
                    As the race entered its 4th hour rain started to fall, but everybody stayed out in the damp conditions, with the shower being brief and the track soon dried out again.
                    Into the 5th hour and problems continued for #007, the car went off and got stuck in the gravel, forced to be towed out.
                    Meanwhile The two Peugeots cruised home with #1 factory car taking the win ahead of #4 Oreca car, as #8 Audi completed the podium.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row in qualifying ahead of the two Audis, and #07 controlled the start as #7 Audi took 2nd.
                    #37 Intersport briefly took 3rd in the opening laps, but #08 Peugeot soon retook 3rd as it fought back, eventually taking the lead as #07 hit traffic and #7 also benefitted to demote #07 to 3rd.
                    A safety car in the opening hour saw The Audis and #07 Peugeot make their first stop, with #08 staying out and maintaining the lead. #7 rejoined in 2nd ahead of sister #9 as #07 dropped to 4th.
                    #08 made its first stop as the race entered its 2nd hour, handing the lead to #7. However #08 cycled back to the lead as the others made their 2nd stop later in the 2nd hour.
                    As the race entered its 3rd hour #9 Audi had a close call, going off the track avoiding another car and lost 2nd to #07 as it rejoined across the grass.
                    More problems for #9 as it hit a kerb later in the 3rd hour and suffered a lot of damage to the nose and floor, the car limped back to the pits and went into the garage as the safety car came out.
                    The leaders pitted with Audi cleaning the radiators for #7 as #07 rejoined in the lead ahead of #7 and #08.
                    The race restarted around the 3 hour mark, and #08 tried to fight back but tangled with #7 and spun. Another safety car later in the 4th hour saw the leaders pit with #7 taking the lead as #08 was delayed in a congested pit lane.
                    Another safety car in the 5th hour saw #08 stay out and take the lead as #7 and #07 stopped, the latter rejoining in 2nd.
                    The race restarted approaching the end of the 5th hour and #7 immediately attacked and took 2nd from #07. #08 made its next stop as the race entered its 6th hour, and a safety car later saw all three contenders stop again with #7 rejoining in the lead.
                    #08 gradually worked its way back up and took the lead before another safety car saw both Peugeot pit, with #7 staying out and cycling to the lead.
                    Into the 7th hour and #7 lost pace, dropping behind #08 before stopping out of sequence for a driver change. The car rejoined a lap down to the leading Peugeots.
                    As the race entered its 8th hour another safety car saw #08 pit from the lead, but #07 stayed out and kept #7 a lap down. #07 and #7 gradually cycled throught their stops with #08 ending up back in front.
                    From there #08 Peugeot controlled the closing hours to take the win ahead of #07, with #7 Audi finishing 3rd after a late puncture a few laps from the end.

                    Peugeot locked out the front row ahead of the two Audis, with #2 controlling the start.
                    #1 was under pressure from the Audis as #8 took 3rd from #7, and as they hit traffic #8 moved past the Peugeot into 2nd.
                    The leaders made their first stop towards the end of the opening hour, with #2 maintaining the lead ahead of #1 and #7.
                    Throughout the 2nd stint the Peugeots pulled away, with the Audis struggling more on older tyres. Once they all made their 2nd stop in the 2nd hour #7 started catching the Peugeots.
                    #7 continued closing the gap to #1 and by the end of the 3rd hour it took 2nd.
                    The Audi then started catching the leading #2 Peugeot, meanwhile #1 was dropping back and coming under pressure from #8 until the 2nd Audi pitted early in the 4th hour.
                    #7 stopped shortly after before continuing at a scorching pace. #2 stopped later in the same hour, leaving #1 leading but under pressure from #7 which took the lead shortly after.
                    #1 then lost 2nd to sister #2 before making its next stop late in the 4th hour.
                    That left #7 in the lead ahead of #2, until the Peugeot went off the road and lost time going across the gravel.
                    #7 pitted at the start of the 5th hour, #8 following it a few laps later. #2 made its next stop 15 min later and handed the lead back to #7, and drama shortly after as #1 tangled in traffic and limped back to the garage with damage.
                    A brief safety car allowed #2 to close the gap to the leading #7, which made its final stop at the end of the 5th hour.
                    #2 stopped for the final time and rejoined ahead of #7, which had been held up by #1 which was 3 laps down after the earlier incident.
                    #2 Peugeot thus cruised to the finish ahead of #7 Audi, with sister #8 completing the podium.

        <h3>Season Totals:</h3>
        <p>Number of Races: 16
        <br>Total Distance Covered: 18851.229 km
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>2011 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>The ACO updated the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=0D318527-1143-FDC9-35F41F8829BF4F89.html" target="_blank">technical regulations for 2011</a>, focusing on downsizing the engines and making the cars more efficient. The new rules also enabled hybrid systems like the ones seen in F1.
        <br>Audi revealed a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=D6C83B46-1143-FDC9-35E8831E4C2C7EEF.html" target="_blank">new car for the new regulations</a>. The team entered the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B9BB732E-1143-FDC9-35EB2166B4F461AF.html" target="_blank">2nd season of the ILMC</a>, but the R18 wasn't ready for Sebring, with the team entering the old R15s.
        <br>Peugeot too revealed a new car for 2011, <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=ED496F20-1143-FDC9-35220DDA1EFF755F.html" target="_blank">the 908</a>. Like Audi, the team once again entered the ILMC.
        <br>Aston Martin launched their new car for 2011 in the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=73C0C508-1143-FDC9-35D67673EDFA83F9.html" target="_blank">form of the AMR-One</a>. Like Audi and Peugeot, the aim was the ILMC but the car would debut at the LMS opener at Paul Ricard.
        <br>After going into administration in 2010 a group of people led by Jacques Nicolet from Oak Racing purchased the assets of Pescarolo Sport when it was auctioned off, and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=B145E1FC-1143-FDC9-358FFE71DCB827F5.html" target="_blank">handed it back to Henri Pescarolo</a>. The Pescarolo Team rose from the ashes and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=5DAB806C-1143-FDC9-35D6D6C3AD15D971.html" target="_blank">brought their 01 Evos up to spec</a> to run <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=A78CBEA8-1143-FDC9-350BACC71C753672.html" target="_blank">1 car in the LMS</a>.
        <br>Highcroft went into 2011 continuing the partnership with HPD, planning to run the <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=120B1A72-1143-FDC9-355DA8BB64CECC65.html" target="_blank">latest evolution of the ARX-01</a>, now in LMP1-spec.
        <br>With Acura withdrawing after 2009 and HPD continuing the program, for 2011 they continued their partnership with Strakka Racing in Europe, as well as forming a new partnership with RML. However following the earthquake in Japan Highcroft was forced to <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=FA5FE085-1143-FDC9-35301C3281381F9F.html" target="_blank">abandon the partnership</a>, withdrawing from the rest of the season due to financial reasons.
        <br>ALMS released an <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=9A6CD783-1143-FDC9-35E5366E34D885CA.html" target="_blank">updated calendar for 2011</a>, with Utah dropping off and a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=CF0A5CD3-1143-FDC9-356EE437F2CF1C5E.html" target="_blank">race in Baltimore coming in</a>. Another race was planned in Oklahoma City, but the local government <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=D64A1E04-1143-FDC9-352EAD093CBE0775.html" target="_blank">voted against funding the race</a>. ALMS also announced changes to the class structure, moving back to <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=68D9A729-1143-FDC9-353CF149C4D7F657.html" target="_blank">separate LMP1 and LMP2 classes</a> as they did before 2010.
        <br>LMS revealed a <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=9837C8D2-1143-FDC9-358FE2CC3AC7CDAA.html" target="_blank">new calendar for 2011</a>, with new races at Imola and <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=D0C3198A-1143-FDC9-357E2FCF825BC1CF.html" target="_blank">Estoril</a>, with the races now running to 6 hours. LMS also <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=7C1648F5-1143-FDC9-35C42F7CDACF973E.html" target="_blank">announced class changes</a> with LMGT1 phased out, and LMGT2 becoming LMGTE-Pro and LMGTE-Am.
        <br>The ILMC released an <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=993C6556-1143-FDC9-35636BD216291411.html" target="_blank">expanded calendar for 2011</a>, sharing Sebring and Petit Le Mans with ALMS, Spa, Imola and Silverstone with the LMS, and the 24h of Le Mans becoming part of the championship. <a href="http://archive2.dailysportscar.com/viewArticle.cfm@articleUID=0C39F344-1143-FDC9-35221C91847B404D.html" target="_blank">Zhuhai again closed the season</a>.

        <h2>2023 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>3 years after the announcement of the convergence between the top class in IMSA and FIA/ACO, the new LMDh cars debuted in the GTP class, marking the first time since 2013 and the ALMS-days that the top class was shared between the European and American premier sportscar championships. 
        <br>BMW returned for the first time since 2000 <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2022/06/06/bmw-reveal-2023-m-hybrid-v8-lmdh.html" target="_blank">with the new M Hybrid V8</a>, for the first year racing with 2 cars in IMSA together with team RLL.
        <br>Porsche announced its return to the top class since 2017, <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2022/06/24/porsche-reveals-race-ready-963-for-hypercar-and-gtp-programmes.html" target="_blank">revealing the 963</a> and partnering with Penske Motorsport to run 2 cars in IMSA and 2 cars in the FIA WEC. 
        <br>Cadillac <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2022/07/08/cadillac-shake-down-new-lmdh-racer.html" target="_blank">debuted the V-Series.R</a> to race in both IMSA and WEC, with Chip Ganassi Racing operating 1 car in WEC and one in IMSA, with Action Express Racing operating a second car in IMSA. 
        <br>Acura <a href="https://www.autosport.com/imsa/news/acura-reveals-arx-06-lmdh-car-for-2023-imsa-season/10353995/" target="_blank">launched the ARX-06</a> for a full season in IMSA with 2 cars operated by Wayne Taylor Racing, which also announced a partnership with Andretti Autosport, and Meyer Shank Racing.
        <br>Ferrari returned to the top class for the first time in 50 years <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2022/10/29/ferrari-499p-hypercar-unveiled.html" target="_blank">with the new 499P</a>, Joining the WEC with 2 cars operated by AF Corse.
        <br>After 2 years of testing the ByKolles Vanwall project finally made it onto the FIA WEC grid, despite <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/02/03/bykolles-lose-euipo-case-over-vanwall-trademark.html" target="_blank">legal issues with the Vanwall brand</a> still hanging over the team.
        <br>After debuting half way through 2022, Peugeot went into its first full season in the WEC, joining Toyota and Glickenhaus along with the newcomers in a record entry in the top class.
        <br>Isotta Fraschini also <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/isotta-fraschini-reveals-new-hypercar-with-aim-of-2023-wec-debut/10437589/" target="_blank">launced a new LMH</a>, but with a very short timeline they were rejected from a full season entry in the WEC. The team initially targeted a debut mid-way through the season, but eventually decided to focus on testing in order to <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/07/06/isotta-fraschini-prep-for-public-on-track-debut-for-tipo-6-hypercar.html" target="_blank">debut in 2024</a>.
        <br>With Porsche and Ferrari both focusing on their Hypercar/GTP programs, resulting in potentially only Corvette running in GTE-Pro, the FIA and ACO decided to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/wec-drops-gte-pro-class-for-2023/10319372/" target="_blank">end the class at the end of 2022</a>, leaving GTE-Am as the only GT class in the WEC for 2023.
        <br>WEC started a gradual expansion after conservative seasons following COVID-19, keeping the races from 2022 and <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/wec-2023-calendar-expands-seven-rounds-portimao-returns/10375988/" target="_blank">adding a race in Portugal</a>, having previously been there in 2021.
        <br>IMSA made a few <a href="https://www.autosport.com/imsa/news/calendar-revealed-for-2023-imsa-sportscar-championship/10349437/" target="_blank">changes to their calendar</a>, dropping Mid-Ohio and Detroit and adding a new event at Indianapolis.

                    #60 Acura led the early stages with the #25 BMW hitting trouble less than an hour in with a hybrid issue, spending several hours in the garage.
                    #01 Cadillac briefly took the lead when the #60 Acura had to make several pit stops under a safety car period 2 hour in, changing the tail after suffering rear wing damage. However the Acura re-took the lead with a faster stop under another safety car an hour later.
                    #7 Porsche also suffered a hybrid issue around the 6 hour mark, losing several laps changing the battery in the garage.
                    Throughout the night the Acuras developed issues with the oil system, #10 requiring a short trip to the garage to replace the oil filter and oil filler cap. The #60 was having similar issues, having to make several pit stops to manage the issue while staying withing touching distance of the lead lap.
                    As Sunday morning approached the #31 Cadillac slowed and went into the garage with broken suspension after contact, dropping several laps down. Soon after the remaining #6 Porsche spun off, suffering rear damage and dropping out of the lead battle as it pitted for repairs.
                    Throughout Sunday morning the BMWs suffered more issues, #25 with a minor gearbox issue and #24 had brake issues requiring a visit to the garage. The #7 Porsche also suffered a broken water pipe, costing more laps.
                    Drama as the #6 Porsche suffered a gearbox failure 3 hours from the end, stopping on track with smoke coming out of the rear, retiring after getting back to the pits on electric power.
                    The fight for the win was mainly contested by the #60 Acura and the #01 and #02 Cadillacs, however with a series of safety cars in the closing hours, the #10 Acura went from 2 laps down to the lead lap, and it soon took the Cadillacs for 2nd, however the #60 Acura held on in the closing stages to take the win.

                    #50 Ferrari led from pole as #94 Peugeot suffered a gearbox failure on the formation lap and went straight to the garage. An early SC saw the two Ferraris pit for fuel, leaving the Toyotas in the lead. On the restart #708 Glickenhaus stopped on track with electrical issues, eventually getting going again.
                    1h into the race #93 Peugeot also suffered a gearbox failure and dropped down the order as it went to the garage. As the leaders made their first stop the Ferraris briefly cycled back to the front until they made their 2nd stop. The battle for 3rd towards the end of the 2nd stint was fierce between #6 Porsche and #2 Cadillac, the Porsche struggling on worn tyres. #94 suffered a hybrid issue and pulled into the garage and retired.
                    #7 Toyota led until the 2nd stop, where #8 stayed out 2 more laps and came out ahead. #708 suffered more electrical issues and stopped on track, retiring from the race.
                    Contact between #93 Peugeot and #4 Vanwall near the 3h mark as the FCY came out, #93 spinning and #4 having to pit with bodywork damage.
                    As another FCY came out #8 Toyota was about to pit from the lead, but could only take emergency fuel as the pits were closed, having to come in again when the race went back to green, however it kept the lead. However it later lost the lead as it was saving fuel, dropping behind #7.
                    Drama at the 6h mark as #51 Ferrari had contact in traffic, crashing out and suffering a puncture and substantial rear damage, dropping several laps down while in the garage.
                    Vanwall had a steady race, until a suspension failure in the 7th hour, it too spending time in the garage fixing the damage.
                    #7 cruised home to take the win ahead of sister #8, with #50 finishing 3rd

                    #31 Cadillac led the opening stages as #01 Cadillac and #10 Acura traded places in the first stint, before #01 took the lead at the first stop. A safety car restart during the 2nd stint saw #31 struggle on old tyres, dropping down the order until it had contact with a spinning car and then scattering debris everywhere trying to stay out before being forced to come in.
                    When the leaders pitted #10 took the lead, but trying to double stint tyres it dropped down the order leaving #01 back in front. #6 Porsche suffered early issues, first diagnosing a hydraulic issue under the safety car, and then a puncture 3h in cost it time. During the 4th hour #24 BMW went off and suffered damage, and #6 slowed on track with fumes in the cockpit, as #7 Porsche suffered suspension issues and pitted for repairs.
                    #01 had built a substantial lead, but a safety car at the 5h mark wiped it out with #10 taking the lead after pitting just before, with the rest stopping when the pit lane opened. #31 made it back to the lead lap, and traded places multiple times with #01 for 2nd overall until another SC, at which point #24 BMW stopped on track and retired with overheating.
                    After the restart #01 struggled on old tyres and dropped from 2nd to 7th, as a bizarre incident under SC at the 7h mark saw an LMP3 car unlapping itself hit the rear of #6, both cars suffering damage. #31 took the lead as the leaders cycled through the pits, with #10 penalized for speeding.
                    After a safety car during the 9th hour #01 muscled its way into the lead, with #10 following it into 2nd, dropping #31 to 3rd, however at the 9h mark #01 pitted from the lead and retired with engine failure. More drama with less than 2h to go as #60 Acura lost a wheel and stopped on track. The leaders pitted in anticipation of the SC, leaving #25 in the lead until it stopped when the pits opened and changed the brakes, with #6 taking tyres.
                    On the restart #6 Porsche on new tyres took 3rd from #31, and after another SC restart with 1h to go it took 2nd from #7, pressuring #10 for the lead, banging wheels. #31 made its final stop, with #7 pitting to serve a penalty for a pit stop infringement as another SC came out. When the pits opened #10 and #6 made their final stop, with #7 also pitting for new tyres. On the restart #6 again went aggressive and took the lead, with #31 shuffled from the lead to 4th, until with 18 min to go #6 was baulked in traffic, contact with #10 ending in both cars crashing out, #7 failing to avoid it with all three cars eliminated.
                    That left #31 leading ahead of #25, and they controlled the pace as the race restarted with 5min left to take the win

                    The two Acuras locked out the front row, as #01 Cadillac spun and crashed at the start, with #60 Acura also spinning after contact with #25 BMW.
                    #10 Acura led the early stages ahead of #6 Porsche and the two BMWs. #31 Cadillac made a very early stop just 15 min in, dropping almost a lap down.
                    As the leaders made their only stop of the race, #10 went from the lead to 5th after being delayed at its stop, with the Porsches ending up 1st and 3rd after not taking tyres.
                    #31 Cadillac pitted from 2nd for its 2nd stop with 30 min to go, leaving #7 Porsche 2nd under massive pressure on old tyres, first from #25 BMW until it went off, then the #10 Acura.
                    After enormous pressure #10 Acura took 2nd, with #25 following it through having also re-joined the battle with the #7.
                    #10 quickly caught the leading #6 and tried to take the lead with just 2 laps to go, but braked too late and crashed out, leaving #6 Porsche to take the win

                    Toyota locked out the front row, with #7 taking an early lead and #51 Ferrari briefly in 2nd until #8 re-took the place. #93 Peugeot started from the pit lane after having to change the steering column before the race. 
                    The two Ferraris argued over track position in the first stint, with #50 eventually getting ahead, with the two Toyotas too swapping places before the end of the first stint. 
                    As the cars cycled through the first stops, both #6 Porsche and #2 Cadillac jumped the two ferraris by not taking tyres, however both cars struggled in the second stint, with #2 having to stop again after suffering with a flat spot.
                    Drama in the 2nd hour as #7 Toyota pitted from 2nd with a problem with a driveshaft torque sensor, the team forced to stop and change the parts, losing 7 laps. Problems also hit #51 Ferrari in the 3rd hour, suffering problems with the front braking system and having to make an extra stop to help the brake cooling.
                    #5 Porsche slowed on track and pitted at the 4h mark, but after rejoining seemingly without problems it came back in shortly after with a power steering failure and dropped out of contention.
                    #4 Vanwall suffered a brake failure and crashed out just before the 5h mark, bringing out the safety car. In the final hour #51 suffered a brake failure too, and slowed dramatically to nurse the car to the end.
                    #6 Porsche looked set for 3rd place until it had to make a late splash of fuel to make it to the end, however it managed to hang on to finish ahead of the #2 Cadillac which finished 4th after running off sequence since the tyre issues earlier in the race.
                    Meanwhile #8 Toyota went unchallenged to take the win ahead of the #50 Ferrari

                    The race started in damp and cold conditions, with half the cars starting on slicks and half on wets. After multiple spins and cars struggling to keep pace with the safety car an extra formation lap was added.
                    #7 Toyota started on pole, but fell back on slicks along with #3 Cadillac and the Porsches. The wet-shod two Ferraris led the early stages ahead of #2 Cadillac, until an early safety car, at which point the track had dried enough that the slick runners could catch back up.
                    #7 Toyota re-took the lead followed by #6 Porsche as the wet runners all pitted. Once on slicks, the two Ferraris struggled heavily to get up to temperature, haemorrhaging time and going a lap down. #5 Porsche and #8 Toyota gradually made their way towards the front, #8 having started at the back after an accident in qualifying.
                    #6 Porsche lost time during the first pit cycle, falling behind #3 Cadillac and #8 Toyota as #7 maintained the lead, however #8 suffering on worn tyres fell back behind #6.
                    Drama in the 2nd hour as #3 Cadillac suffered a heavy accident after a power steering failure, the car retiring with the driver sent to the medical centre.
                    #6 Porsche was holding a strong 2nd place until a complete electrical failure saw the car stop on track and retire, as at the same time #4 Vanwall went off and got stuck in the gravel.
                    Problems continued for #4 Vanwall, after briefly stopping on track before driving back slowly to close the door in the 4th hour, it got tangled up in traffic and crashed out of the race.
                    After pitting in the 5th hout #50 Ferrari exited the pit lane and immediately crashed out on cold tyres, it too retiring from the race.
                    #7 Toyota controlled the lead through the final stints despite late pressure from sister #8, including a 5 second penalty for overtaking off the track. #5 Porsche was set for 3rd place until #51 Ferrari hunted it down and took the place on the final lap

                    Porsche locked out the front row, but both cars locked up into T1 allowing #60 Acura to take the lead ahead of #31 Cadillac, with #6 slotting in 3rd.
                    #7 then had contact in traffic, sending #94 off the track and earning it a drive through penalty. The resulting safety car saw the leaders make their first stop with #31 Cadillac taking the lead ahead of #25 BMW and #01 Cadillac, with the Acuras and Porsches taking tyres and losing track position.
                    The Acuras and #6 Porsche fought back as others struggled on old tyres, #24 BMW shuffled back from 4th to 7th until another safety car came out at the hour mark.
                    That saw a 2nd stop from the leaders, with BMW and Cadillac taking tyres, allowing #60 Acura to cycle to the lead ahead of #31 and #10 Acura. As the race restarted #31 pressured #60 and took the lead as #7 Porsche went off, clipping the wall and forced to pit with substantial damage.
                    The Acuras struggled for pace on old tyres, with #01 Cadillac taking 3rd and catching and passing #60, which was dropping like a stone to the back of the field.
                    The leaders made their final stop with 1 hour to go, with everyone taking fuel and tyres to go to the end. #31 initially held onto the lead ahead of #01 and #25 despite going wide exiting the pit lane. After another safety car #01 took the lead and cruised home to take the win, despite #31 initially maintaining the pressure before dropping back. #6 Porsche took #25 BMW for 3rd, before reeling in and passing #31 for 2nd in the last 20 min.

                    Ferrari locked out the front row ahead of #8 Toyota and #75 Porsche, but #708 Glickenhaus was forced to start from the pits after a gearbox leak on the way to the grid.
                    #50 Ferrari led away from pole, but struggled on a wet section of track after earlier rain, and #8 Toyota took the lead on the first lap as #311 Cadillac crashed and brought out the safety car. The car returned to the pits with heavy damage and went several laps down.
                    On the restart #7 Toyota took 2nd from #50 Ferrari, but as the Toyotas struggled on their softer tyres #50 re-took 3rd before making its first stop.
                    #7 Toyota struggled, losing 3rd to #51 and coming under pressure from the trio of Porsches. The rest of the leaders made their first stop with #8 maintaining the lead.
                    As cars gradually cycled through their second stops several cars took turns leading, with #2 Cadillac in front at the 2h mark. #3 Cadillac was involved in an accident after being collected while slowing for a slow zone, returning to the garage and going laps down.
                    The lead continued to change hands as cars were cycling through stops at various rates due to the amount of slow zones. #6 Porsche hit problems in the 3rd hour, losing time with a puncture and dropping a lap down. Rain started falling as the race approached 3 hours, and as it intensified conditions became undrivable, with #3 Cadillac and #709 Glickenhaus aquaplaning off.
                    The safety car was deployed due to the conditions, and the leaders all pitted for wets. Once the pit stops had cycled through it was #94 Peugeot leading, with #38 Jota 2nd. After spending a hour under safety car the track had started to dry again, with some of the cars moving back to slicks before the restart. #93 Peugeot went off after stopping for slicks and got stuck in the gravel.
                    As the race restarted #94 still led from #6 Porsche and #7 Toyota, but all three soon stopped for slicks. That left #38 Jota in the lead ahead of #5 Porsche, but the two Ferraris were moving up the order and relegated #5 to 4th as #6 Porsche suffered another puncture.
                    #38 controlled the lead until dramatically crashing out approaching the 5h mark, bringing the car back with substantial damage, triggering an FCY to clear the debris. By this point Ferrari had taken control of the race, #51 leading until a swap with #50 to effectivise pit stops, however #51 was back in front by the next stop. #709 Glickenhaus suffered more issues, a loose wheel dragging under the car costing a lot of time by the time it made it back to the pits.
                    Heavy rain started falling again in the 7th hour, with trecherous conditions causing several cars to aquaplane off. Everyone pitted for wets, with #51 Ferrari maintaining the lead ahead of #94 and #7 after #2 Cadillac spun off in the awful conditions.
                    #75 Porsche stopped on track towards the end of the 7th hour, eventually bringing the car back to the pits and retiring with fuel pressure issues.
                    As the rain eased the leaders gradually pitted for slicks, #51 Ferrari still leading ahead of #94 Peugeot and #7 Toyota. #4 Vanwall was having a miserable race, including an off into the gravel in the 8th hour.
                    Drama as #51 Ferrari went off from the lead into the gravel just before the 8h mark, handing the lead to #94 Peugeot ahead of #7 Toyota and #50 Ferrari.
                    Just a few moments later more drama as #7 Toyota was involved in an accident, getting collected while slowing for a slow zone and suffering two punctures and a broken driveshaft, retiring from the race.
                    The order was #94 Peugeot in the lead ahead of #50 Ferrari and #2 Cadillac as first an FCY and then a safety car was deployed to clear up the accident.
                    With more pit cycles in the 9th hour #50 lost time in the pits, with #8 Toyota taking 2nd ahead of #2 Cadillac.
                    As the race restarted #8 Toyota took the lead until its next stop, as #5 Porsche went into the garage in the 10th hour with hybrid cooling issues, dropping down the order. At the end of the hour #50 Ferrari also went ito the garage with a water leak, dropping several laps down.
                    By the time #94 had made its next stop #8 Toyota was back on its tail and took the lead in the 11th hour, with #51 Ferrari having come back to demote #94 to 3rd.
                    #94 Peugeot then crashed in the 12th hour, dropping out of the podium fight as it brought the car back to the pits with heavy front end damage. That left #51 Ferrari with a narrow lead as the race reached half way, after taking the lead in the pits when #8 Toyota took full service.
                    As the pit cycles continued #51 Ferrari had its full service stop at its next stop, leaving #8 back out front in the 13th hour. As dawn broke #4 Vanwall suffered an engine failure and retired in the 16th hour, capping off a miserable race.
                    After an impact with a squirrel caused damage to the front splitter #8 Toyota started losing pace as the race approached 16 hours, and a slow puncture meant #51 Ferrari took the lead at the next stop with a nose change and new tyre for the Toyota. Around the same time #3 Cadillac had moved into 4th with #6 Porsche serving a penalty. Trying to catch back up #6 went off after tangling in traffic, going into the garage at the next stop with floor damage.
                    #708 Glickenhaus spun off into the wall in the 17th hour, with #709 going off in the same place an hour later, both cars forced to visit the garage for quick repairs. Meanwhile #94 Peugeot also went into the garage quickly to check the oil temperature.
                    #51 Ferrari continued to hold the advantage throughout the morning until a slow pit stop just after the 18h mark, with the car failing to start and requiring a power cycle. #8 Toyota took the lead, however #51 fought back to re-take the lead on track later in the 19th hour.
                    Problems continued for #6 Porsche, with another visit to the garage with hybrid issues in the 19th hour, followed by another stop an hour later to replace the battery system. Meanwhile #311 Cadillac went off into the gravel after slowly moving up the order after the first lap crash.
                    As the race moved into the 21st hour the Peugeots hit problems, with #94 going into the garage to replace the steering rack, and #93 replacing the nose after a nose panel flew off before being forced to come in again with hydraulic issues.
                    With 2 hours to go #8 Toyota was starting to catch the leading #51 Ferrari, but drama as the car went off and hit the wall in the penultimate hour, falling almost a lap down after pitting for new nose and tail.
                    That left #51 Ferrari with a comfortable lead, and controlled the final stages to win the race despite a long final stop with another power cycle. #8 Toyota came home 2nd, with #2 Cadillac taking 3rd after a near problem-free race.
                    #5 Porsche suffered late gearbox issues, spending the last half hour in the garage, with #709 Glickenhaus also going off and getting stuck in the gravel in the final hour.

                    #6 Porsche started on pole as championship leader after qualifying was cancelled, alongside #31 Cadillac and #10 Acura.
                    The Porsche controlled the lead at the start as #01 Cadillac took 3rd and #24 BMW crashed out and triggered a safety car.
                    #10 Acura suffered a tyre pressure issue and was forced to make an early pit stop, ending up out of sequence.
                    #7 Porsche made its first stop just before a safety car, cycling to the front as the rest of the leaders made their stop when the pits opened. #6 rejoined in 2nd ahead of #60 Acura after a fast stop, while #25 BMW made another stop for a splash before the restart.
                    #60 Acura was then dealt a drive through for speeding in the pit lane, leaving #31 Cadillac in 3rd. As the race reached the hour mark #01 Cadillac spun off after tangling in traffic, with #25 BMW also collected. Both cars had to stop for repairs, with the Cadillac making several more stops as the race restarted to finish the repairs and then suffering a puncture on the out lap.
                    #10 Acura took 3rd from #31 later in the 2nd hour, and as the cars cycled through the 2nd stop around the 2h mark #7 Porsche initially maintained the lead, but after being baulked in traffic #6 took the lead. Drama early in the 3rd hour as #7 Porsche pitted and went straight to the garage and retired with hybrid issues. That left #10 Acura in 2nd ahead of #60, but shortly after #10 slowed on track after losing a wheel, dropping 2 laps down after pitting for a new wheel and then a drive through for speeding in the pits.
                    #31 Cadillac stopped for a splash out of sequence in the 3rd hour, and cycled to the lead as the rest of the leaders made their regular stops, allowing it to lead at the 3h mark. #6 Porsche re-took the lead as #31 made its scheduled stop early in the 4th hour, with #60 Acura 2nd until it pitted with a puncture shortly after.
                    That left #31 Cadillac back in 2nd, with #25 BMW taking 3rd. The drama continued for #01 Cadillac in the 4th hour as the car was involved in a pile up, triggering a safety car and forcing more repairs. All the leaders pitted with #31 taking the lead ahead of #60 Acura, with #6 rejoining 3rd. As the race went into the 5th hour #25 BMW pressured #6 and took 3rd in traffic, and as the leaders gradually made their penultimate stop the BMW cycled to the lead. The problems continued for #10 Acura as the car pitted in the final hour and retired.
                    #25 BMW maintained the lead as the leaders made their last stop in the final hour, but #6 Porsche started closing in, and as they battled through heavy traffic the Porsche went through to take the win in the final stages. However after the race #6 Porsche was disqualified due to a technical infringement, #25 BMW being declared the winner.

                    #7 Toyota qualified on pole ahead of #50 Ferrari, with #8 Toyota and #93 Peugeot filling the 2nd row.
                    #7 and #50 controlled the start but #8 tangled with #51 Ferrari, with the Ferrari spinning and the Toyota also dropping down the order, leaving #93 in 3rd.
                    The Peugeot then took 2nd as #8 tangled in traffic trying to fight back, sending #777 off and bringing out the safety car. #51 Ferrari, #2 Cadillac and #6 Porsche all pitted for a splash under the safety car along with #38 and #99 as #8 was penalized for both incidents.
                    As the race restarted #93 Peugeot muscled its way past #7 to take the lead, with #50 Ferrari also demoting #7 to 3rd.
                    The rest of the leaders made their first stop at the 1h mark, with #38 Jota Porsche cycling to the lead ahead of #6 Porsche and #2 Cadillac.
                    When the leaders made their 2nd stop in the 2nd hour #50 Ferrari took the lead ahead of #5 Porsche and #7 Toyota, with the Toyota and #93 both delayed at their first stop.
                    The rest of the leaders made their 2nd stop towards the end of the 2nd hour, with #5 Porsche emerging ahead as #6 Porsche cycled to the lead.
                    #94 Peugeot struggled with electrical issues, and into the 3rd hour it stopped on track, limping back to the garage to try to diagnose the issue.
                    #7 Toyota and #50 Ferrari both passed #5 Porsche before a safety car saw #6, #51 and #2 all stop while the pit lane was closed and had to come in again when the race restarted.
                    #7 Toyota cycled back to the lead ahead of #50 Ferrari and #5 Porsche. #5 then pitted out of sequence in the 3rd hour after trying a triple stint. That handed 3rd to #93 Peugeot, until the leaders made their 3rd stop by the end of the 3rd hour with #7 maintaining the lead.
                    The Toyota pitted from the lead for the final time with 45 min to go, with the rest of the leaders following shortly after, with #7 Toyota cruising home to take the win ahead of #50 Ferrari and #93 Peugeot.
                    After the penalties earlier in the race #8 Toyota fought back to finish 4th, but another penalty after the race for excessive energy usage dropped it back to 6th.

                    #25 BMW made its 2nd stop early in the 2nd hour, handing the lead back to #60 Acura.
                    A safety car later in the 2nd hour saw the leaders make their 2nd stop, with #10 Acura taking the lead ahead of #31 and #60.
                    The leaders gradually pitted for a splash in the final hour as several safety cars punctuated the running, except for #60 Acura which stayed out and cycled to the lead ahead of #10 and #25 BMW.
                    Contact between #24 BMW and #01 Cadillac saw #01 crash out of the race with 5 minutes to go, the race finished under the resulting safety car allwoing #60 Acura to take the win after stretching the fuel for well over an hour.

                    #31 Cadillac qualified on pole ahead of #7 Porsche, but after a crash in the warm-up #31 was forced to start 10th behind the rest of the GTPs.
                    More drama before the start as #25 BMW went off on the formation lap, forcing the race to start under safety car.
                    #7 Porsche controlled the start ahead of #01 Cadillac, as #60 took 3rd from #10.
                    Trying to fight back #25 crashed out and retired early in the race, bringing out the safety car.
                    #6 Porsche suffered a puncture in the first hour, forcing it to make an early stop and dropping it down the order.
                    The leaders made their first stop at the end of the first hour, with #7 maintaining the lead ahead of #01 and #60.
                    #01 struggled in the 2nd stint, with #60 taking 2nd in the 2nd hour, and #10 also taking 3rd towards the end of the 2nd stint.
                    The leaders made their 2nd stop at the end of the 2nd hour, #7 staying out front after taking 2 new tyres with everyone else taking 4.
                    #24 BMW slowed during the pit cycle and briefly stopped on track before limping back to the pits and retiring with electrical issues.
                    #7 controlled the final stint to take the win despite #60 Acura closing the gap and increasing the pressure, with #10 Acura finishing 3rd.

                    Toyota locked out the front row with #7 on pole as Porsche filled the second row.
                    Chaos as the start as almost everyone went off the track, #6 Porsche took the lead ahead of #50 Ferrari as the Toyotas were shuffled down to 3rd and 6th. Contact in the melee saw #5 Porsche suffer a puncture and then a penalty for pitting under the resulting safety car dropped it a lap down.
                    As the race restarted the Toyotas started trying to move back up, but #7 ended up on the grass and dropped to 4th behind #51 Ferrari as #8 took 5th from #2 Cadillac.
                    As the first stint went on the Ferraris started to struggle with tyres, and #7 took 3rd from #51 before #8 followed it through, before #7 caught and passed #50 for 2nd.
                    #6 Porsche made its first stop from the lead early after a fuel issue. #8 then demoted #50 Ferrari, as the rest of the leaders made their first stop around the hour mark, with the majority taking fuel and two tyres.
                    By the time everyone had stopped #38 Jota Porsche cycled to 3rd after taking fuel only, as did #2 Cadillac which ended up ahead of the two Ferraris. #6 Porsche resumed the lead ahead of #7 Toyota, and #8 which soon took 3rd from #38.
                    #50 continued to struggle and dropped behind sister #51, then fell behind #2 and ended up fighting #99 Proton Porsche for 7th. #2 also struggled, eventually dropping to 8th behind #94 Peugeot.
                    The leaders made their 2nd stop around the 2 hour mark, with #6 continuing to lead ahead of the Toyotas. The Ferraris moved back up the order and started the 3rd stint 4th and 5th.
                    The two Toyotas gradually started catching #6 for the lead, both having saved some fuel over the opening stints. Into the 4th hour and #4 Vanwall tangled in traffic and was handed a drive through.
                    After making their 3rd stop #7 started pressuring #6 for the lead, with #8 eventually joining the fight after saving fuel. The two Toyotas then started fighting each other for 2nd until #7 ceded the place after running out of tyres.
                    #8 then put pressure on #6 and just before the end of the 4th stint the Toyota barged its way through and took the lead.
                    By the time the leaders pitted at the end of the 4th hour #8 led, with #7 also jumping the Porsche to lie 2nd as #5 went into the garage with steering issues.
                    Drama for #2 Cadillac shortly after its stop, losing a wheel and limping back to the garage with a suspected hub failure.
                    #8 started struggling with the handling after the 4th stop, and let #7 through to take the lead, as the Ferraris too swapped position with #50 now 4th.
                    #7 continued to lead as the leaders made their final stop after 5 hours, with #8 still struggling. #93 Peugeot and #4 Vanwall both hit problems, a long stop for #93 with hydraulic issues and #4 went into the garage with cooling problems.
                    The Toyotas cruised through the final hour with #7 taking the win ahead of #8, as #6 Porsche completed the podium.

                    Porsche locked out the front row with #7 on pole ahead of #6 and #60 Acura.
                    Chaos at the start as #7 went wide and contact between #60 Acura, #24 BMW and #01 Cadillac saw #01 spin and #60 also delayed. #6 took the lead ahead of #7 and #24.
                    The resulting safety car saw #01 pit for repairs, and after the restart #24 also pitted with a slow puncture and a few laps later with electrical issues, leaving #25 in 3rd.
                    Confusion as another safety car saw the leaders make their first stop late in the opening hour. #6 maintained the lead through the stop, but #31 Cadillac was alongside #7 exiting the stop but had to drop in 3rd. As the cars were reordering for the restart #31 was ordered to take the lead after the Porsches were deemed to have failed to respond to race control in time.
                    #31 thus led the restart as the race entered its 2nd hour, with #7 moving past #6 for 2nd. The Porsches pressured the Cadillac and later in the stint #31 went wide and handed the lead to #7, with #6 also going through.
                    The leaders made their 2nd stop late in the 2nd hour, but #7 went off on the out lap and handed the lead to #6 as #25 BMW rejoined 3rd ahead of #31.
                    #6 Porsche thus controlled the closing stages to take the win ahead of sister #7, with #25 completing the podium.

        <h2>2024 Season</h2>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>After competing in the Hypercar class in 2021 and 2022 with the rebadged Rebellion LMP1 car, Alpine <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/06/09/alpine-unveils-a424-beta-hypercar.html" target="_blank">revealed the new A424-Beta</a>, set to compete in the WEC.
        <br>Another newcomer to the top class was Lamborghini, <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/07/13/lamborghini-reveal-sc63-hypercar-and-gtp-contender-at-goodwood.html" target="_blank">revealing the SC63</a> and preparing to compete in the WEC as well as the endurance events in IMSA.
        <br>After competing in IMSA with Acura in 2023 and following the partnership with Andretti, WTR <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/05/16/wayne-taylor-racing-doubles-up-in-gtp-for-2024.html" target="_blank">added a second car</a> to its campaign for 2024. Conversely, after a controversy with tyre pressures at the Rolex 24, Meyer Shank Racing split with Acura at the end of the season. Unable to find other alternatives, the team <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/10/03/meyer-shank-to-pause-imsa-gtp-programme-in-2024.html" target="_blank">paused its sportscar program for 2024</a> to focus on Indycar.
        <br>Following the elimination of the GTE-Pro class after 2022, FIA and ACO made <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/06/09/fia-wec-reduced-to-two-classes-for-2024.html" target="_blank">further changes to the class structure</a> in the WEC for 2024. The GTE-Am class was phased out and replaced by the LMGT3 class, based on the much more widely used GT3-spec cars. At the same time the increase of entries in the Hypercar class forced the organizer to eliminate the LMP2 class from the FIA WEC, leaving the series with only 2 classes in 2024. LMP2 cars were however still eligible in other ACO supported series like the ELMS, AsLMS and IMSA, as well as at Le Mans.
        <br>IMSA also made changes to the class structure for 2024, with the <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/05/03/lmp3-removed-from-weathertech-class-structure-for-2024.html" target="_blank">LMP3 class eliminated</a> due to the other classes seing increased interest. The LMP3 class was added in 2021 to fill up the grid at a time when reduced interest caused smaller grids at several events.
        <br>The FIA WEC revealed a <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/06/09/eight-round-2024-fia-wec-calendar-released.html" target="_blank">new calendar for 2024</a>, continuing the gradual expansion following the COVID years. The new calendar featured a new event in Qatar, as well as a return to Interlagos and COTA and a first visit to Imola.
        <br>IMSA revealed a <a href="https://www.dailysportscar.com/2023/08/04/endurance-cup-expands-to-five-rounds-for-2024-imsa-season.html" target="_blank">revised calendar</a> with a new event in Detroit together with IndyCar replacing Lime Rock, with Indianapolis becoming a 6 hour endurance. The calendar also saw several revisions of which classes competed at which events.
